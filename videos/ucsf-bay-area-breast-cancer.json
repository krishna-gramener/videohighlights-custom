  "text": " We'll go ahead and get started. Welcome to the Bay Area Breast Cancer Forum. We're really happy that you could be here with us this evening to talk about ASCO, the updates on breast cancer from ASCO, the American Society of Clinical Oncology, 2024. ASCO has been now in Chicago for quite a number of years because it's a big enough location to host all of us. So apparently the contract runs out. We'll see where we end up at some point. but that's where, you know, we have really three and a half big meetings a year where advances in breast cancer are presented for the first time and sometimes follow-up are also presented. And these presentations really impact our understanding of breast cancer as well as our approach to treatment. And they help us design the next set of studies as well. So I have with, I'm Hope Rugo, breast medical oncologist at UCSF. and I am here with Melody Galu who has organized the breast cancer forum now with me for many years. Thank you, Melody, for your tireless work, and Melody does this, as does everybody, as volunteer work, really, to help you guys in the community of the Bay Area to have a chance to ask questions and to really hear about the newest updates. in our, before I introduce everybody, in our Zoom meeting, you can see at the bottom, there's a Q&A button, has a little question mark in it. Please put questions there, comments, anything that you want to say to the group. Put the Q&A there, and our speakers will also be able to look at it and answer it. Sometimes we'll be able to answer those questions live. Other times they'll be answered within the Q&A function, which allows us to type in answers. So we'll look forward to hearing from you because this is meant to be. be interactive. We just can't everybody talking, of course. I am joined by my fabulous colleague. So on the surgery side, we have Michael Alvarado, breast cancer surgeon extraordinaire. And one of our surgeons who is doing specialized training, already finished training in surgery, but is doing specialized training in breast cancer surgery, which is really what we need to help patients the most, Danny Tang. And thank you both for being here. And then I have my colleagues in breast medical oncologist, Dr. Joe Chen, who is a breast medical oncologist who actually runs a number of studies that are institution, including our endocrine optimization, neoadjuvant endocrine program through ISPI, which is a very cool study as well as many other studies. And then Laura Hubbard, who joined us on faculty after fellowship now a year and a half ago, two years. Two years now, two years ago. And, yeah, two years ago this month, right? And is running a number of different studies, has some varied research interests as well, and both of my colleagues have very active breast cancer clinics and run trials. And then Kelsey Natsuhara, who's our senior breast oncology fellow, and is doing a number of different research studies, including research studies about reaching patients through telemedicine visits. It's a really cool study funded by, it has lots of other features, but it's funded by our American Society of Clinical Oncology, as well as the Association for Cancer Research. So we have a great panel of people here with us tonight. So definitely put your comments in as we go forward. So we're going to start with our two brief presentations, one about central node biopsies, one about local treatment in patients who already have cancer that's spread outside the breast and nodes metastatic disease. So Annie will talk to us. about the first presentation now. All right. So once again, I'm Annie Tang. I'm one of the breast surgical oncology fellows here at UCSF. So I'm going to be talking about two papers first, one of which that was presented is talking about axillary lymph node staging. So for those of you who don't know, so what is surgical axillary staging? They're typically two types. So one of which is called a sentinel lymph node biopsy, which means that we are only removing the first few lymph nodes that are draining the breast. So typically, this is done with the radio tracetaceous that's injected, and only the first few lymph nodes are lit up, and during the surgery, we would remove those lymph nodes. And typically what I kind of tell patients is, you know, when we worry about breast cancer, we worry about breast cancer, not in the breast, but if it has spread somewhere else in the body. So typically, the breast cancer cells in the breast will make a few bus stops before crossing the state lines, and these are the sentinel lymphones. nodes, and these would be removed during the sentinel lymph no biopsy. However, the other one of the, so one of the side effects, of course, of sentinel biopsy is that there's about a 5 to 10% chance of lymphadenia. The other type of surgery, which sometimes is, it's a bigger surgery, and what that entails is the axillary lymph node dissection, and we are removing all the lymph nodes in a low light cell. So we're not just removing just the blue lymph nodes, we're removing also the ones that are colored in green. And with that, with this bigger surgery, it typically means more complication. So in this case, a 20 or 30% chance of edema. And if you add on top of that radiation, that can go up as high as 3. So why is this important? So one of the abstracts that was presented at is looking at axillary surgery with breast cancer patients who receive new adjustment therapy. So in this patient population, so this is breast cancer. So this is breast cancer patients who had positive lymph nodes and then had new adjuvant therapy, they had surgery and was found to have residual positive lymph nodes after the sentinel node biopsy. Right now, we're not entirely sure how much additional surgery or radiation is needed in this patient population. There's an ongoing clinical trial right now, the Alliance trial, looking and comparing with posterior lymph node dissection and lymphoibio with radiation. One of the trials that was presented at ASCO had looked at the two prior trials, NSABP 40 and NSABP 41, in which both of these patient populations had new adagement chemotherapy. And retrospectively, looking at this data, they looked at and compared patients who had sentinelibibopsy alone, sentinel lymphobopsy with axory lymph node dissection, and x-ray lymph node dissection alone. Once again, this isn't a randomized trial comparing these lymph nodes procedures, but looking back at the patients who had these procedure and comparing the outcomes of that. So what they found after a median of four and five years, in the B40 trial where they had 500 patients, these are the numbers that I experienced an event. An event typically means either a local recurrence within the breast, a recurrence that is regionally in the lymph nodes, or a recurrence somewhere else in the body. And overall, they have found that there's disease free survival with some. similar in all these different groups of various lymph node procedures. Similarly, in the B-41 trial, they also, of 112 patients, they also had found that there was a similar disease-free survival in these groups. So what they found was that the sentinel lymphno biopsy, when compared in astray lymph and dissections in this patient population, who had neurologent therapy, had similar likelihood of recurrences, meaning that if there's a possibility, in these type of patients that we might not necessarily need the more aggressive surgery that does have more complications. So the next topic that we're going to talk. I'll just say something real quick. Sorry, that was wonderful, Annie. And just to kind of just to bring it home, again, in patients and women and men that have surgery for breast cancer and we find a few cells in the, lymph node, if they hadn't gotten any therapy before surgery, pretty much all of the clinical trials and data and reviews have shown that the bigger surgery doesn't benefit these people, which is great because we've eliminated doing the bigger surgery, which has all the complications. So there's lots and lots of data to show that most of the time we don't need to remove all the lymph nodes and we don't have to have all those potential complications. and kind of the last area that we're not 100% sure, I think a lot of us feel we kind of know what the answer is, is that if somebody has it found that it's already spread in the lymph nodes when they first get diagnosed, and they might see somebody like Dr. Rugo or Dr. Huppert or Dr. Chen or when she's finished as well, is that they get their therapy before surgery, so the neoadjuvant, and if there's still some cells left in the lymph nodes at this time of surgery, kind of what we've been doing is removing all the lymph nodes just in case. Even though we kind of feel that it's probably not necessary, we're waiting, as Dr. Tang said, we're waiting for that big alliance clinical trial to give us this last piece of information. But what she's shown here is that we've gone and found some other clinical trials that, again, are giving us similar, outcomes of what we're expecting, showing that there's probably not that much difference. So we're currently at UCSF, and there are a lot of places across the country. We're really individualizing treatments when patients have the therapy before surgery, and if there's a little bit left in a lymph node and you've taken out three or four lymph nodes, we really feel that they probably don't need the bigger surgery and they've gone on to radiation. We've really taken it as a patient-by-patient kind of discussion, with all of us together. Hopefully, as Dr. Tang was saying, we'll get the data from the big alliance trial, which will kind of answer that question for almost all patients. So sorry, Dr. Tang, I didn't mean that. I just want to kind of like bring it all back together. No, no, that was perfect. No, and I think that what was really nice to hear about here is that even this is in the situation where even when you have cancer in the lymph nodes, that the standard approach of taking out all the rest of the lymph nodes to make sure you've got it all, so to speak, isn't help you more. So we know there's a few other lymph nodes that could have cells in there. But with the standard treatment that we're giving, we can help patients do just as well without getting a lot of swollen arms and pain and numbness, et cetera. So it's a big change in thinking. And I have to say it's a little bit slow to be picked up because outside of our surgeons, Many surgeons think that doing more surgery is always better, but I think that this is a really important change. So let's go on to your next topic, Annie. Yeah. So the next topic, now we're going to talk about a different patient population, so stage four breast cancer. So these are patients with breast cancer in which the breast cancer has spread to another organ in the body. Typically, what that treatment is, the most important thing is usually the systemic treatment, and that can be chemotherapy, hormone therapy, targeted therapy, or immunotherapy. Then we also have the local regional treatment, and this is typically radiation surgery. And currently kind of in the role for stage four breast cancer, it resides mostly for patients who have symptoms, either bone pain or if there's a bleeding wound or within their breasts. So the topic of controversy here for surgery is how does it affect in this patient population on survival and local regional occurrences? So in this other abstract that was presented, a randomized control trial comparing primary tumor resection, plus systemic therapy and metastatic breast cancer. This was a study that was done in Japan, and it's a randomized trial, and it had included 570 patients who had stage 4 disease and was started on some form of systemic treatment. And then 407 of these patients did not have a rectory disease. and were randomized, meaning that they had some sort of response to the treatment that they were getting. And the two groups that they were comparing was systemic therapy plus surgery or just systemic therapy by itself. And what they had found out was that there was no difference in overall survival between the two groups. So having surgery did not make a patient live longer, essentially. And then when you look at the local recurrence, comparing those two groups, there was a higher local recurrence free survival in the patients who underwent surgery at 63 versus 20 months. So in general, the conclusion from this abstract was saying that primary surgery is not recommended for all patients, but it can't control local disease and is susceptible in a select group of patient population. And the most notable that they had mentioned were those with a single organ metastasis. So if there was metacitis in just, for example, just the liver. And also in those with hormone positive or ER positive disease. So in summary from these two trials, the first one being talking about the lymphno biopsy. So after they reviewed the B40 and B41 trials, they have found that patients who had in the management therapy sentinel biopsy had a similar recurrence rate compared to those had sentinel fibsy and the bigger, more aggressive surgery, the accident dissection. And right now, there's an ongoing trial that will compare these two to really show us, do we really need this more aggressive surgery, or can we have the less aggressive surgery with less side effects and still have the same outbreaks? And then the last one is that surgery does not improve overall survival in patients with metastatic disease, but may improve local regional appearances in select. patient populations. Yeah, great. And I'll just kind of finish up with that last one that you presented. So just for a quick background history, for a long time in the 80s and 90s and early 2000s, the thought was if it's already spread outside and kind of somewhere deeper in the body, we're not really going to do any surgery. Even if you have a lump you can feel in your breast or maybe there's one lump you can feel in your armpit because the thought was, you know, just do the therapy that, for example, Dr. Nat Suhara was giving you or Dr. Rugo or anybody, that's the most important thing. We're not going to operate on you. And then they look back retrospectively and said, maybe there are some people that benefit. And then we started offering the surgery. And then there was more data showing that maybe it doesn't help, maybe it does help. So I think what's important is that we really take. this at a person-by-person discussion because there are a lot of things that go into it, not just is it going to have you live another 15, 20, 30 years, or is it going to make you feel better because you're not feeling this thing in your breast or there's this one thing in the lymph node and everything else looks like it's disappeared? So we definitely take it on a case-by-case discussion. I think myself and Dr. Tang have operated on patients that we've had referred to us from all of our oncologist team here and there where they've been. done this amazing job with all of the therapies and everything's gone away and there might be one little thing in the breast that still lights up or one thing in a lymph node. And we think that sometimes that, you know, if we can do it without harming the patient and it's a pretty easy thing to do, then we think it might be beneficial. But we definitely take it a case by case. But this just kind of adds to the body of knowledge that we shouldn't just rush to do it on everybody, but we really need to think about what we're doing. That's great. And so let me just ask you guys a couple of questions that came up in the Q&A. So the one question was, let's see, are the results the same regardless of, for the Sentinel node, the first presentation, are the results the same regardless of which type of breast cancer the patient has? Yeah, great question. Those studies, yeah, we think it probably is independent, so it probably doesn't matter what the biology is, that the radiation is going to be more effective with less complications than the bigger surgery. Now, having said that, it is more common that women and men, too, but mostly women, that have estrogen, the so-called triple-negative breast cancer, so estrogen-negative, H-2-negative. It's more common that that biology, and it's more common that the H-2-positive biology, get the therapy before surgery. So a lot of the evidence is showing those types of patients. That's just because those are the ones that mostly get the therapy before surgery. But having said that, as the people on the participants will know as well as obviously the faculty, there are estrogen positive breast cancer patients that are hurt too negative that also need therapy before surgery. And it seems that also in those cases that the big lymph node surgery is probably not going to be that beneficial. Now, when you get to the very, the biology where it's estrogen positive, progesterone positive, it's a low grade, but you're getting maybe anti-estrogen therapy up front and you have two or three positive lymph nodes that haven't changed, that's a hard to know for sure. So in those ones, I think it'll take a little bit more information. But I think that was a very long-winned explanation. Sorry, good thing my wife's not here. She'd kill me. I'm the worst storyteller, she says. She's like, get to the point. So the point is, yes, it's pretty much broadly for all patients. That's helpful. And then in the B40-41 trials, did they identify the breast cancer type, like lobular ductal? That's actually kind of a hard place, right? Yeah. No, and that kind of goes, yeah, no, and Dr. Rue was point. That kind of goes to that whole concept of the a little bit lower grade. The biology seems to be less super fast growing lobular breast cancers. Those patients don't always get therapy before surgery. So it's hard to know in those cases. But I think we just have to kind of wait and see what the data shows in that big trial. And then as we all do, we try to figure out with each patient how they fit into the information. Yeah. And so that's really helpful actually to think about it because in lobular, we just don't really have as much data and we know there can be nodes that we don't see or feel or can't see by imaging. So we don't really know the answer yet to that difference between ductal and lobular in terms of, you know, should you remove all the nodes or not. But in terms of the, let's see, there's one other question I think I'll ask you. So axillary node, lymph node dissection and radiation 17 years ago. Does the patient sell a risk of lymphodema? Yeah, great question. Go ahead. And had a sentinel lymph node biopsy without radiation 15 years ago on the other side. Yeah, no, great question. So, you know, it is true that lymphodema can happen any time. The fact that this participant is that far out, it's probably unlikely to happen. Now, having said that, there's sometimes things to get. It can trigger it, you know, and nobody knows for sure because this data is not super great either, but an infection in that arm for some reason. I mean, this is a very kind of tail, but, you know, working, you know, you're in the rose garden for some reason. You have roses and you get a bunch of cuts on your arm and it gets infected and causes an infection, what's called a cellulitis. that can trigger lymphedema, those types of things. So it's probably unlikely this far out that something like that would happen. But if anybody on the webinar notices any change in what they think might be, then they should come see us or someone nearby where they are because now there are a lot of things that can be done, not just physical therapy, but for early identification, there's even sometimes surgical therapy that can help with it as well. Yeah, so I think that that's, now there's this new lymph re, what is it really called? It's a lymphovascular bypass, so where you take the lymphatic in the armpit that maybe looks like it's broken and you connect it to a vein in the armpit so that the fluid can has a place to pass through. And it just depends. I mean, the idea of prevention now has been really popular, but because it seems as a treating established lymphotema is more difficult, but it might help. So one of the questions that's interesting before we go on to the Medank parts also involves Medonk, and maybe I'll ask Laura, Joe, your opinions about this. The question is with respect to resection of the primary tumor in patients with stage 4 disease, metastatic disease, did they do a subgroup analysis of people who had a complete response to treatment like those with her two-directed therapy? So, you know, because that's one of the big issues. And we, you know, we have three randomized trials looking at surgery where really all comers were evaluated. So I don't know, what's your, I mean, the problem is there's never, none of these trials are big enough to look at this upset. So the question I posed to you, I guess I start with Laura, is, you know, do you feel like having a complete, response, you know, at distant metastatic sites and the subtype of disease influences your decision to do local therapy. Yes, absolutely. So, yeah, I think per two positive disease in particular, we know that patients can have very prolonged responses. And so if they have an excellent, if a patient has an excellent response to therapy and they have control elsewhere, but they still have that breast mass present, you know, those are patients where I am more interested in doing local regional therapy so that, you know, hopefully it's less likely to become a problem later. I think ideally it's nice to see that people do have that for long response. And then even after you put them on sort of maintenance therapy, for example, with something like Perceptin and Progetta for those her two positive patients, the things sort of stay quiet because you don't want to put someone through a surgery that then their cancer grows really quickly. They, you know, didn't need that surgery and that will delay other therapy. And so you kind of want to prove that it's working well and they're stable before jumping into the surgery. But those are the types of patients where I will consider it. And I think particular patients with ER positive more indolent disease if they have a really long duration of response or if it causing more pain or issues that might you know drive me to do it more But I think most often I've done it in patients with her-toe positive disease. Yeah, and I think of note in the one study that was done in the U.S., the patients with triple negative disease had actually a slightly worse outcome because you have to stop all their systemic therapy, so we don't like to do it in that setting. And then, Joe, another question that came up was, is local regional recurrence considered as stage four, like recurrence in subpectral lymph nodes? No, so any local recurrence or local regional recurrence is not a stage four diagnosis. It is local or local regional, and that's a big distinction. It is still curable, and that is still our goals when we treat local regional recurrence. and sometimes that still requires, well, always usually requires surgery, sometimes radiation, and usually we will change and add systemic therapy. But the goal is cure. Great. So that was a fabulous part of start to our discussion this evening. I thank Andy and Michael very much for being here. I don't know if you want to add anything else before we go on to the next section. No, super great. Thank you so much for having us. Thank you. And then I'll point out to our attendees, if you look, look in the chat, although you should only put your comments into the Q&A, but in the chat, Melody has put our link, which is cancer.ucsf.edu forward slash forum, and then the email as well. So if you go to that website, the next forum dates, the links to recordings, and then Bay Area Breast Cancer Forum at ECSF.edu is the email to be added to the list, serve, ask questions, or we really appreciate it when you also suggest topics. So definitely make note of those. So there's a question about CT DNA. So I thought maybe what we would do, not to put you on the spot, Kelsey, but to start with CT DNA discussion, a very interesting presentation, although there was a whole session on circulating tumor DNA in early stage disease, this I thought was a particularly interesting presentation from our monarch e-trial. That sounds great. Let me just get my slides shared. Okay. Okay. Can you say it? Yes, we can. Perfect. All righty. Well, I am Kelsey Anahara. I'm a third-year oncology fellow. I get to work with Dr. Rugo, Hupor, Chen, Alvarado, and really lucky to get to train here. I'm really excited to get to talk to you about some of this great work that came out of ASCO this year. So I will be presenting this presentation that was presented at the early stage breast cancer session. And just a little bit of background on this study. So this study was looking with an analysis of the Monarchy trial and a little bit of background for this study. You know, we know that patients with node positive, hormone positive breast cancer are at high risk of breast cancer occurrence. And the rates are estimated about 30% at five years. And so this has been an active area of research where we know that we need better therapies for these patients. And so Monarchy was a really exciting study where they showed that adding a Bemisyclic, which is a CDK-4-6 inhibitor to endocrine therapy could reduce the risk of recurrence for these high-risk node-positive patients. And they presented the data that this risk of recurrence was reduced by 7% at five years. And a bemiclyclyb is now FDA approved for high-risk node-positive patients in the early-stage setting. So this study particularly was using the Monarchy data set to look at circulating tumor DNA, or what we refer to as CTDNA as a prognostic marker. So just a quick aside on what is circulating tumor DNA. I liked this graphic from Wikipedia. But basically what it shows is, you know, in your bloodstream, you've got all of your normal cells. You have, and you shed little bits of DNA into the blood. And the tumor will also shed little bits of DNA into the blood. And in tests, we can actually differentiate what comes from tumor cells and what can come from normal cells based on the types of mutations that are present. And so there's been a lot of interest in how can we use this circulating tumor DNA test as both a diagnostic and a prognostic tool. And so that's what we'll be talking about a little bit today. Colloquially, sometimes these tests people talk about them as liquid biopsies and the brand names you may hear are things like Signatura. So what they did in this study is they looked at the entire monarchy population of 5,000 plus patients. and they included patients both who are randomized to abemocyclyb and endocrine therapy versus endocrine therapy alone. And then within this trial, they had a subset of patients who were in this biomarker population, where they were collecting additional blood tests for more sampling. And among those patients, 910 of those patients had enough samples that they could run these circulating tumor DNA tests. So just to highlight, this was a pretty small subset of the overall trial, was only 16% of patients who had sufficient samples. And what they looked at were both patients who had a baseline blood sample where they could look at circulating tumor DNA. And then a fewer patients had more than one sample so that they could look at changes in the circulating tumor DNA and understand how this might impact patients' prognosis. So just to show kind of the overall, what they were looking at here is of all the patients and how many patients had a distant recurrence. And just like Dr. Tang said before, you know, the thing we worry about in breast cancer and the thing that is life-threatening is when breast cancer spreads outside of the breast in the lymph nodes and comes back as metastatic. Just throwing this slide here to show that the circulating tumor DNA cohort was really enriched for patients who had recurrences. This was a higher risk population and we'll talk more about that soon. And what they showed here was they were looking at how many of the patients in the circulating tumor DNA cohort versus the total cohort had recurrences. And again, higher in the circulating tumor DNA cohort than in the kind of overall population. And then they looked at kind of changes in circulating tumor DNA over time. And what they showed was that rates of positive circulating tumor DNA were very low at baseline. And so, you know, only 8% of patients actually had a positive circulating tumor DNA test at baseline. So right when they started on the trial, whereas 92% of patients had no circulating tumor DNA that was detected. And this has been a problem with using circulating tumor DNA in the early stage setting is that we don't think there's enough cancer cells around to shed DNA into the bloodstream so that we can actually detect it on a test. And I think this is just a nice illustration that the detection rate was very low. But what they were able to do here then was to look at how that changed over time. And you can see that 10% of the patients who had an initially negative circulating tumor DNA test became positive down the line. 90% of those stayed negative. And then in the group of patients who had a positive test at baseline, 59% of those patients stayed positive over time and 40% of patients then had a negative test. And they looked at, you know, what this meant for patients. And so they showed that for patients who had detectable circulating tumor DNA at baseline did much worse than patients who had a negative test at baseline. And the rate of recurrence was 80% versus 23% for positive circulating tumor DNA versus negative. And then they looked at those subgroups that we talked about. So what you can see is patients who never had detectable circulating tumor DNA by far did the best. And patients who had a positive. And patients who had a positive test and stayed positive the whole time did the worst. I think these groups in the middle are particularly interesting. What they looked at were patients who started negative and then became positive in the red, that 10% we talked about, do also do quite poorly, and they look pretty similar to the patients who were positive at both time points. And then conversely, those patients who started with a positive circulating tumor DNA test and then became negative did better. you know, they still don't do as well as the patients who were negative all along, but that the rates of distant recurrence were much, much less. Most of the recurrences that they saw for this circulating tumor DNA positive patients were distant recurrences, where interestingly, most of the recurrences they saw for the patients who were negative circulating tumor DNA were local recurrences. And then this slide is just showing, you know, how long did it take from the time they found a positive? circulating tumor DNA test until someone actually had a detectable recurrence. And you can see that it was actually quite short. It was, you know, most of the time or, you know, less than 18 months or two years or so, from the time you had a positive test to the time that you developed a recurrence. So suggesting that this is a really, you know, good marker that there is more cancer around than we would like. So the conclusions that they drew from this study was that number one, I think that the rates of detecting circulating tumor DNA is quite low even in this really high-risk population. If you do have a positive circulating tumor DNA test at any point, this is a poor prognostic sign, remembering those patients who started negative and then became positive. And then the time to developing a recurrence after detecting a positive circulating tumor DNA was relatively short, less than two years. And then I think really interestingly, I think there is benefit we see, even if you start. positive and then become negative, those patients do better. And so I think that's really kind of the question in this study is, you know, how can we help those patients who have positive tests and get more of those patients to be negative? We don't know the answer to that yet. And I'm really interested to see more kind of work hopefully come out in this area. What they didn't show in this paper was whether or not a Bema Cyclib, you know, really could reduce those positive to negative tests and what other therapies can. can we use in this setting if we detect a positive circulating tumor DNA, you know, I think the feeling from both patients and providers is that we want to be able to do something with that test information. And I think right now we don't know exactly what the best treatment is to give in those settings. And so I'm really curious to hear from Dr. Rugo and Chen and Huppert, too, about other thoughts they have. Yeah, that was an excellent summary of this really fascinating data. I think remember that it was a subset of patients in the monarch. population. Now it's our standard of care to give two years of the CDK-4-6 inhibitor of Bemisiclip or Verzenio to patients who have higher risk early-stage curable breast cancer because of the remarkable data. And ribosycliber, or Kisgali, also has positive data, but it's just earlier in the evaluation and it's not yet approved by the U.S. FTA. We don't expect that approval to be until later this year because they need to reformulate the drug due to some very tiny contaminants. So I think this is a really important area because we're trying to figure out what to do with the data. So I'm interested, Joe, in your take on this. And then a question that came up also was on the CT DNA discussion. Is it applicable? I mean, would you just do this clinically? What about someone who's 10 years after a breast cancer diagnosis? Yeah, I think. I feel like this is obviously very interesting, and this is sort of the way the field is moving. The technology is available that's commercially available, and it's clearly prognostic. What is lacking at the moment are validation studies to inform us how to use these data. What we really need is a trial that shows, okay, if you detect positive CT DNA and you intervene, with X, Y, or Z, that you can improve the long-term outcome of that patient. And it's hard because I think we all live in the space that feeling like, well, it's always better just to know and more information is good. And, you know, I can see that argument, but I think there's still a lot of nuances. I think about the population of patients that were positive and then 40% of them became negative, right? How do we predict who are going to be in that 40%? And what's happening in those years between positive to negative, I suspect there will be a lot of anxiety leading to additional tests, procedures, potentially leading to additional complications. And so it's really complicated. What we need in the field, our data to say, if you start new treatment with a positive CT DNA, meaning you are starting that treatment much earlier than you otherwise would, would that lead to better long-term outcomes? Or the flip side is that potentially you're just exposing the patient to toxicity sooner, potentially breeding more resistance in that tumor, and potentially running through your treatment options faster than you otherwise would have. It's really an important question to answer. So at this point, I do not send this test routinely in my patients. I'm following the field really closely, and when we get that data, absolutely, I think it is really valuable and can be impactful and important. I mean, I think all patients, I think every patient of mine, after they're done with treatment, ask, how do we follow? Right. And we know that doing scans are not helpful, right? But that's currently the best we have. I think CTDNA is where we're going and potentially there are even better technologies out there like onk RNA and other things that are in development that might be even better. But right now, we don't know what to do with the data. Yeah, I think that that's a really important point and very well said. You know, you have a, you know, first of all, the chances of having positive CT DNA, there was another study that looked at patients who were five years out, and it took the multiple tests to even just find 8% of the patient population who had CTDNA positive, and we don't even know what to do with the information, and although that definitely predicted risk of recurrence, there were some patients who remain CTDNA positive. We've seen this with all of the trials who never recurred. So it could just make you feel terrible without knowing. There are studies going on, of course, trying to change treatment based on CTTDNA testing, but there were so many problems finding patients who had positive CTDNA. One of the studies, they limited it now to just four or more positive notes because they just couldn't find enough positive patients. And one of our studies we were doing closed because they just didn't have enough patients, even with bad triple negative disease who had CTDNA. So it's something definitely in evolution. And, you know, I really appreciate the people who put into the Q&A. I don't know if you've seen them, Kelsey, which is fantastic presentation, Kelsey. Thank you. So there you go. So very nice. So another question, I think, is what, Laura, what do you do if you're not in a high-risk group with the CTDNA discussion? So I think in some ways it's like, what if you don't have high-risk disease? What's the benefit there? Yeah. So I think Dr. Chen just went through in general how we don't yet know whether we should send CTDNA even in the highest-risk patients. And so I think we have even less, you know, data or information. to use it in lower risk patients. I think the rates of CTDNA positivity will be lower if you have clinically lower risk. And then if you do come back positive, is it then a false positive or if it's a real positive? You know, as Joe just mentioned, like, what do you do with that information? We don't yet know if changing therapy or intervening actually will improve outcomes. And so I think I have even less, I guess, enthusiasm for using it yet in the lower risk patients. But like Joe, I'm not yet using it at all outside the context of clinical trials at this point. And then Kelsey, somebody asks whether or not that you could use CTDNA for lobular versus ductal. Is there any difference? Oh, that's a great question. You know, I don't know if there's any specific data on lobular versus ductal. I think that would be really interesting since lobular, you know, is really challenging to detect overimaging. And that's been an ongoing issue. So I think what we've seen is, you know, the higher the disease burden, you know, these node negative patients, metastatic disease is really where you see circulating tumor DNA. And I think the problem has been the lower limit of detection and how sensitive these tests are. And so I don't know enough about, you know, whether or not that would be different in modular versus ductal. But maybe Joe does for Dr. Alfrado. No, no, I just had another question. I definitely don't know, but I've said another question. I don't think that, you know, in terms of looking at lobular inductable by CTDNA, we can definitely detect CTNA in lobular cancer. But I will say that lobular cancer, even in the metastatic setting, we see less CTDNA because patients can have these sclerotic bone lesions, which are dense bone lesions. They just don't put out the cells into their blood quite as much, even with metastatic disease, which is, you know, frustrating. You know, the tumor markers might be normal, et cetera. So you may see less in slow-growing hormone receptor-positive disease with CTDNA. And we certainly see less in the metastatic setting. So it will be for sure less than the early-stage setting. And I'll just add that Dr. Rita Muktar, what of our surgical colleagues and I are, you know, we're working on a trial, registry trial for metastatic globular patients, really trying to ask this question for many reasons, including is it similar to. but also because, as you know, lobular cancers tend not to show up on scans, right? CT scans, MRIs. And so it's actually a hard disease type to follow. And oftentimes these patients aren't eligible for clinical trials because clinical trials require what we call measurable disease where you can like a discrete liver lesion. And we see that less often in lobular cancers that like to grow in sheets, right? So they don't show up like a mass. And so what I think is a really important need in the field is to identify other tools to follow patients' response in lobular disease because scans are not sufficient. And if we can do that, then we can increase trial enrollment for lobular patients. Yeah, I think that that's really important because the trials exclude patients who don't are measurable disease, and so we end up without these patients in trials. Yes, Michael. Thank you. Sorry. What about looking in a different light with CTDNA and looking at the possibility of de-escalation? So neoadjuvant therapy or therapies, maybe CTDNA before surgery, after surgery, and then changing or de-escalating therapy based on the circulating tumor DNA? I think it's a great question because in ISPI, we have done some very nice work. Mark McBanawa has published looking at CTDNA and showing that you could potentially increase the intensive therapy in patients who have CTDNA that persist through treatment. We don't know if that's going to help us clear it or not, but I think it's a really cool idea. and the question about de-escalating is interesting. Like right now we use MRI and biopsy to try and give less therapy. Adding CTDNA would probably improve that ability to determine which patients need less or more. And I think that could be really good and make people more comfortable with the idea that you could only get a little treatment. If your cancer melts away and you have nothing at surgery, it's enough. Because people are still worried that it's not enough, even though you'd, given that treatment. Other thoughts from the group? Another, I think these other questions we can some of them, I think we can answer on and online. Somebody asked if a CTDNA is a form of liquid biopsy could become an FDA-approved marker. And I don't think it, you know, if we show that people who have CTDNA in early stage setting could be cured because they got treatment X, then maybe. But that's way, way far away. CTDNA is an FDA-approved biomarker for finding specific targetable mutations in the metastatic setting like the PIC-3CA mutation or ESR-1, the estrogen receptor mutations, BRCA mutations that are not you're not born with but are required, et cetera. But I don't think just having CTNI or not will be an FDA-approved biomarker. in the next many years, maybe Sunday. Okay, so let's go and talk about another topic. I mean, we have so many things we could ask about and think about. Joe, I think one of the big areas of interest when we started studying CDK-4-6 inhibitors with palbo-siclyb, and now we have ribosyclib and abama-siclip. We use the generic names, but those are iBrands, Kiskali, and Verzenio. And, you know, they, you know, there are side effects to all of these, but overall, they're so well tolerated. There was a lot of interest in whether or not like percepton, we could just continue it through the next hormone agent, and people would still have a better outcome because so nice not to give as much toxicity. So, one trial postmonarch looked at this. What did you think of that data? Excellent. Let me share my slides. Okay. All right. You see that? Okay. So as Dr. Rugo was saying, the question that this trial was asking is, is there a benefit in continuing a CDK 4-6 inhibitor after progression on a CDK-4-6 inhibitor. CDK-4-6 inhibitors with hormone therapy is the standard first-line treatment for tumors that are ER-PR-positive, her-2 negative in the metastatic setting. We know that it can nearly double the duration that we can control the disease. We seen improved survival However we also seen that after first line there there an unmet need in the field to find additional treatments because those tumors can be more resistant And what we give in the second line is not well defined. Right now, there is not a standard, and it really depends on individual patient and tumor factors. For example, tumors that have a PIC3CA or AKT mutation would be great candidates for KAPIVA certib, el-pelisib, tumors that have an ESR-1 mutation. We have oral serds like elastisrant, some braca or germline pelvic two mutations we might talk about later tonight. But it really depends on patient and tumor factors. And many patients don't have a mutation that is targetable at the moment. And so one option could be what about just continuing it, right? if you switch out the hormone therapy and continue the CDK or switch to a different CDK because there's three of them, could that offer a benefit? And so what this trial did, and it's called the Post Monarch trial, was ask patients who were previously on first-line CDK-4-6 inhibitor, at the time of progression, they were randomized. Well, I'll let's show you the study design. They were randomized to either a BAMISIC, continuing hormone therapy, but with a different hormone therapy, Fulvestrant, and continuing a CDK-4-6 inhibitor, in this case, a bemaclyb, versus fulvestrant and placebo. So essentially, continuing a CDK-4-6 inhibitor with abemaclyb, or doing hormone therapy alone. The primary endpoint of this trial is what we call progression-free survival, and really looking at the duration of disease control until the disease starts to grow again. The trial enrolled nearly 400 patients, and this table here shows some patient characteristics. I want to draw your attention to a few things. First is that if you look in the red boxes, in terms of the sites metastatic disease, about 37, 38% of patients had liver disease. Around 20% of patients had bone-only disease. This gives you a sense of how aggressive the disease has developed 60% of patients had we called visceral metastases involving liver, lung, other visceral organs. All the patients had prior CDK-4-6 inhibitors. Most of the patients had palbo-suclib or ribosyclips. So very few, only 8% had prior abemicyclips. So for most of these patients that you are switching to a different CDK-4-6, six inhibitor when you were getting abamic. How long the patient stayed on first line, CDK-4-6 inhibitor? So most patients, 70 plus percent, were on it for more than one year. So these tend to be what we call responsive tumors. About 20 to 30 percent stayed on for less than one year. These are more resistant tumors. And what they found was that there was a significant benefit if you continued abama But that benefit was small. So the median progression-free survival, meaning the amount of time that the tumor is controlled was six months with abamiclyb and feldestrine and 5.3 months with placebo and fulbestrine. So not a big difference, but it was statistically significant. They broke down the patients based on certain subgroups, such as how long they were on their first line. CDK-4-6 inhibitor. In other words, they wanted to look at patients who were hormone therapy sensitive and those that were hormone therapy resistant. And you can see that in patients who were on first-line CDK-4-6 inhibitor for just a short period of time, there was a two-and-a-half month difference benefiting the abemiccicclyb arm. And a little bit longer when you looked at patients who had been on the CDK-460 for more than a year. So a more hormone-sensitive tumor benefited two and a half months, but this was a little bit better. But still, ball differences. And then if you look at patients who had visceral metastases versus no visceral metastasy, you can see that the benefit of the hemicyclips seem to be greater in those who had no visceral metastasies. So patients who had mainly bone or lymph node disease, may have benefited more when continuing the abama cyclibe than patients who had liver or lung metastases. Then they looked at patients who had mutations, right? I just told you that there are other medications that are approved for patients with these ESR-1 mutations or PIC-3-C-A-A-K-T mutations. And they wanted to see patients with these mutations that tend to be resistant mutations if they benefited from the abetamaclyb as well. and they look similar to the overall population, meaning that patients with mutations also could benefit from continuing a bemicclicid beyond first-line CDK-4-6 inhibitor. So to summarize this trial, this was the first phase three trial to demonstrate benefit of continuing a CDK-4-6 inhibitor after progressing on first-line CDK-4-6 inhibitor. But like I said, the benefit was small. It translated to a 27% reduction, but it was a 0.7 month improvement. The other thing worth noting is that the control arm, the placebo arm, performed better than what we have seen previously in other trials. And that's probably a reason that this trial was not as statistically significant as we may have hoped. The other thing worth noting is that the control arm was not really what we would consider the standard of care in the U.S. We know that certain drugs like everalymus is also approved in this setting for patients who do not have a mutation, really approved for all patients. And I think if I had a patient who progressed on first line CDK-4-6 inhibitor and did not have a targeted mutation, I would switch them to fulbestrine and everalimus. So what I would have liked to see is how this strategy compares to fulvestrin and everalimus. And then lastly, my point, I would just note that this benefit, small benefits, it may be dependent on switching the CDK-4-6 inhibitor. Just a minority of patients had prior abama cyclic. Most of these patients were on prior palbo or ribo and switched to abema. So in summary, abema continuing it is an option in patients who don't have a targeted mutation, and who might these patients be? Patients with bone-only, more indolent disease, more hormone-sensitive disease, meaning they were on the CDK-4-6 inhibber for a bit longer, or maybe they did try another drug like ebrolymus or one of the other targeted drugs like El Pelisib or Capoeba CERC. And just can't tolerate it. So continuing the abemisiclip in that setting would be very reasonable. But I would also encourage patients to participate in clinical trials in this space because it is an unmet need. There's a lot of things going on in this space with a lot of new drugs coming down the pike. And there may be, I think this space will, evolve very quickly and there may be better options. And that's it. That's it. Well, why don't you leave up your last slide there? I think that that's really interesting. I want to just remind people, please put your questions into Q&A. We really can't answer them in chat. So if you can just put in your questions that you're putting into the chat into the Q&A, that would be really helpful. There's just no way to respond to the messages in the same way. in the chat so sorry about that but just copy and paste it into there um and we'll we'll get to all of them the uh one of the questions that came up was when the recording will be available um online and on youtube and um well melody can put that into chat potentially and the link um if you're hearing this melody and i will ask you as well if it doesn't come in so uh the uh let's see so i think this is a a really interesting question about who you use a CDK-4-6 inhibitor for and how you balance the side effects. So, Laura, do you have any concerns here about, you know, somebody who had ribocyclib? Does it work as well in that situation? About two-thirds had palbo, right? One-third ribo, I think. Right. Yeah, so it's a great question. So we, there's, to back up, there's three different CDK-4-6 inhibitors, palbosyclib, abemocyclib, and ribocyclib, and all three are approved in front line setting. And we used to use palo cyclid most often because it was the first approved as the combination, CDK-4-6 inhibitor. But the three separate trials, of the three, actually, the only trial right now that has proven an overall survival benefit, meaning patients live longer, ended up being with ribocyclib. And so after these kind of trials published their data, and we saw that that was the only one that had a proven survival benefit, we sort of switch practice to using ribocyclib in most patients in the first line setting. And then this trial was done in the setting where many people were still using palbo first, and then they switched to a bema. And if palbo is just not quite as strong of a CDK-4-6 inhibitor, maybe the switch from palbo to a femma is more effective than if ribo is, in fact, a superior CDK-4-6 inhibitor. If you got that first, maybe switching to a bema is less effective. I mean, we don't know for sure. but I think that is one caveat in kind of applying this data in a modern setting where instead we might be using ribo first because most of these patients got palbo first. And then, Kelsey, any other concerns that you would have about this, like how you make decisions in this situation? Yeah, that was a great presentation, Dr. Chen. I feel like I have asked all of you this question in clinic before as we are seeing these. patients. I think it's really nicely outlined on this slide. I think there's a very specific patient for whom you might consider a CDK to CDK switch. You know, I think the benefit we're seeing is pretty small. And especially, I think, if you have a targetable mutation, you have a PIC3CA, you have an ESR1, and you have better treatment options. I don't think this is something would do, I would do. But just like Joe said, you know, if you don't have a mutation, if you're somebody who had a really good response to first-line therapy, like bone-only disease, kind of slow-growing, and you tolerated it really well, and perhaps you're on palbo for a long time, maybe switching to ribo. It's trappleting from this data. We don't have it yet, or a bemocyclyb. You might get a little bit more benefit before switching to something else. Yeah, I think that that's a really good question. I have really good thought and nicely put. I don't know. Let me just look and see if there's any questions about this specific topic in there. There was a comment, beautiful explanation, Dr. Chen, and absolutely need more people in this kind of trial. There are a few women in this dilemma. Thank you. So very nice question. And then I think one of the other questions is, you know, would you do this after somebody in this trial, Joe, you know, the people went directly after their first CDK-4-6 inhibitor to full-fast Trent, Alabama. Would you do this ever in a patient who had other treatment in between? Oh, that's a good question. That specific scenario has not been tested. I think that if there were no other options. It's a reasonable approach, but that specific scenario has not been tested and we don't have data to inform us. But I think the take home here is the benefit was small, right? And I should also say there have been three other trials testing this question. Okay. Two of them were testing palbo to palbo and they were negative. There was no benefit of continuing the same CDK-4-6 in at the time of progression. One trial tested palbo to ribo, and it was a small study that actually was the impetus for this larger study, and that one did show a small benefit as well. So I think if you're going to do it, it's going to be a different CDK-4-6 inhibitor. But whether intervening treatment, and presumably that's with more effective intervening treatment, whether that will further dampen that already small benefit if you do it later, maybe, but we don't know and it hasn't been tested. Yeah, that's great, and I think very helpful answer. So, Laura, there's also interest in whether or not we could extend the use of these CDK-4-6 inhibitors to patients who have lower risk disease, even those who don't have cancer in their lymph nodes. I know the Natalie trial, which looked at a large spree, spectrum of patients who had higher and lower risk disease looked at ribosyclip for one year longer than the monarchy trial three years. And there was a little subset analysis in node negative patients that was presented at ASCO. Tell us about that. I see somebody raised their hand. We don't have a way to talk to you. Actually, you have to put the questions into Q&A. Sorry about that. Great. So thank you so much. We're switching then. So still talking about CDK. 4-6 inhibitors, but rather than in the metastatic setting, this trial is called the Natalie trial and looked at the use of a CDK-4-6 inhibitor called ribo-cyclib in the early-stage setting. So as you guys, as we just reviewed, there's three different CDK-4-6 inhibitors, all are approved in the metastatic setting. Right now, we have one CDK-4-6 inhibitor that's approved in the early stage setting, and that's a bemocyclib, which is given for two years. And that's in patients who are node-positive and have higher-risk features. And this trial called the Natalie trial is looking at a different CDK-4-6 inhibitor ribocyclin and included higher-risk patients that had node-positive disease, but also included some patients who are slightly more intermediate risks. And how they defined those intermediate risk is you could be node-positive, just like in the Monarch E-trial for a Bema, but you could also be node-negative as long as you had some of these higher-risk features. So if you were node-negative, you had to have grade-2 disease, a higher K-I-5. 67 or marker of cell turnover or a higher oncotype or molecular profiling test, or you could have grade three disease, or as I said, you could be node positive. So these are high risk and intermediate risk patients. They receive their chemotherapy if it's indicated. They get their endocrine therapy. And then the trial randomized patients one to one to receive endocrine therapy by itself versus endocrine therapy plus ribocyclib at a dose that's slightly. lower than the metastatic dose. The metastatic dose is 600 milligrams, three weeks on, one week off. This was using 400 milligrams, three weeks on one week off. And they follow these patients over time to look at whether or not there are recurrences. And so this analysis presented to ASCO focused on the node negative patients in particular, and there were 613 node negative patients. Just to summarize some of the characteristics of these node negative patients, most of them had grade two or grade three, so kind of intermediate or faster proliferating tumors, and then many of them were stage 2A, some stage 2B and 3B, and 71% of these no negative patients had prior chemotherapy. So notably not all patients had chemotherapy, but most of them did. And that kind of went through that as well. And so these are the results, and what they did is they compared the patients who got the ribo plus the arom the aromatase inhibitor versus the aromatase inhibitor alone. And this is sort of the first, you know, one of the earlier time points looking at this data, they're going to continue to follow these patients over time. But at a follow-up right now of about three years, they saw that there was a difference of 2.6% in these node negative patients. So the three-year rate of disease, being free of disease, if you got both the AI and ribo was 93.2% versus 90.6%. with the AI alone, which, as you can see, is a difference of 2.6%. And they also looked at the disease-free interval and distant recurrence-free interval, similar benefit with the ribo arm. And so they also looked, the safety data was relatively consistent with the safety data we've seen with ribocyclib in the full data set and also in the metastatic setting. We monitor for low blood counts. We monitor for elevated liver tests. We have to check EKGs or heart rhythm. So there's a rare risk of heart rhythm prolongation of something called the QTC, but relatively similar kind of safety profile that we've seen before. I think the question and there are these some kind of thoughts about this data, I think it's really nice to see, you know, we all want to do as much as we can to help reduce risk of recurrence for all of our patients. And so the question is for no negative patients that have sort of higher risk features, can we add this class of medications to help reduce the risk of recurrence? And so I think it's really encouraging and nice to see that adding this medication did help reduce the risk of recurrence in this node negative population. I think the challenge is balancing risk and benefit for each individual patient, right? Because these medications also do have side effects and toxicity, some of them which can be more serious. And so we don't want to give it to every node negative patient, but can we better pick out which, node negative patients are sort of higher risk node negative patients and selectively give it to those patients that will benefit the most. So I think that will be a key thing is clarifying which node negative patients are most likely to derive benefit. And then also, it would be nice to see a longer follow-up data over time. It's like I said, it was an earlier look at the data at three years of follow-up, but once, you know, we see five or more years, that'll be even more telling. And so right now, based on the Natalie trial, Adjuvant ribocyclibate is still not yet approved, but I think really encouraging data so far in the whole trial and then also in this node negative subset. And right now, only an abjavit abama cycloid is approved. And so that's sort of what we're using now. But I think starting to think about in these slightly more intermediate risk patients, whether we should be considering the use of CDK-4-6 inhibitors based on this really nice data. Really interesting. So your take on this, first of all, it's not approved yet. But when the, let's say the drug was available to you today, would you treat a patient with no negative disease? Interesting, actually. I was thinking about this for one of my patients today. I think for the right patient, I would definitely consider it. I think a patient that has a bigger tumor in the breast, for example, that's high grade, has a high oncotype score. They have lymphobascular invasion or higher risk pathologic features, even if they're node negative. I think those are the patients I think I'm more inclined to consider using it. I think it's a balance, though, for each individual patient. This is, you know, you have to take the drug for three years. It has all the side effects. And so I think it will really be a patient-to-patient discussion of, you know, is a small percent benefit, potential benefit, you know, worth it for you. And I think I would like to see that longer-term follow-up data. And it's possible with it longer follow-up data. It'll be more than 2.5 percent. Maybe it'll be more like 5 percent or 7 percent, where maybe that's more compelling. I think it's a little bit early, but definitely in those higher risk-node-negative patients, you know, it's tempting to want to reduce risk as much as possible, but not yet approved at this point. Yeah, I am interested, Joe, what your thoughts are. I would be a little hesitant outside of a trial setting now. The wider trial, which we hope to open someday later, maybe towards the end of the year, will include patients who have slightly higher risk, no negative disease. So at least we'll track what's going on there. I'm a little worried about the early time point with reduction in risk, but they did see a reduction at risk of distant recurrence. So you could make an argument, as you noted, Laura, for this higher risk population if you had the drug available. Joe? Yeah, I agree. I have not been prescribing, at least the abema, because that's the only thing approved right now in node negative in general. I think it's really shared decision making, especially at this point, with ribo, if and when it gets approved for the node negative population in particular, knowing that there's short follow-up. And there is toxicity, right? three years where you're immunosuppressed a little bit to some extent, fatigue, maybe nausea. It's a big commitment, and I think it really is shared decision if you're going to do it in the node negative population. Right now, I have not been doing it. Yeah, I think it's an interesting question. One of our attendees asked, what is the genomic risk score and archetype DX? So I don't know, Kelsey, do you want to very briefly answer that one? Sure. You know, the Ancotype DX, which was studying our responder that we talked about, is a genomic profiling test that gives us more information about the biology of the tumor. It looks at gene expression, so RNA, not DNA, to see kind of which genes get turned on in the tumor that make it grow faster. And so that profile, we can look at the different genes that are expressed and either categorize it as high. risk or low risk. And there's a variety of platforms like mammoprint and a few others that you may see. Yeah, and it's interesting actually because we, I remember having a focus group before there were any of these tests available with the person who started the group that does the Ancotype DX score. And the idea was what is the main question you want to answer in early stage breast cancer hormone receptor positive breast cancer was who needs chemo or not? Because a study done in the late 80s showed that patients who had even small hormone receptor positive cancers could benefit from getting chemotherapy. But obviously this wasn't going to be true for everybody. And a lot of it was making women who were pre post and getting rid of estrogen You don need chemo to do that You can do it with an injection So that how the test all started was did you need chemo or not And that how we used them primarily But now we may be expanding a lot of these into other ways as well to understand the biology of the cancer. So that was a really nice explanation. Michael, I don't know if you're on in Annie. Annie is maybe a little past your years, but Michael, I don't know if you're still there, somebody asked about the risk of second cancers after being treated with lumpectomy, radiation, and chemotherapy 18 years ago for triple negative disease, a patient now has B-cell lymphoma, so a cancer of the lymph gland, and a single lymph node on the same side of the breast cancer. And, you know, we just don't see that much. We don't see second cancers. And now with current radiation techniques, the risk of second cancers after radiation is well under 1%. I mean, it's really tiny. But presumably, there's always some. degree of risk. I don't know. I don't know if Michael's on. Annie, if you have any comment about that. Yeah. So mostly the secondary cancers usually isn't secondary to the survey, but like you mentioned, it's secondary to the radiation. There was a recent study that was published last year that had mentioned a secondary cancer. Most notably, it's usually skin cancers that can arise. It's still very, very low percentage. And with the secondary lymphoma, I don't know the specific rates of that, but visionally, I think that would be very low because that would probably be lower than the risk for any skin cancers after the radiation. Does anybody want to comment on that from the group? It is really interesting. I don't know if anybody's ever seen a secondary cancer in this group. The rates are very, very low now, so that's certainly encouraging. So there's actually an interesting question about T cells there in chat, Laura. I don't know if you want to answer that one. So let's just quickly talk about DB 06, Destiny Breast 06, because I just want to make sure we, of course, get to that one. Share my screen. Okay. All right. Okay, so TDXD is also the drug and hair too, as most of our patients know it as, but Trostizumab directs to can is how it was known. Herceptin is Trostizumab. This is a biosimilar to Trisemab, and it is an antibody shown in blue here. And then there's a linker in whatever color that is, maroon. And then there's the little balls on the outside are what's called the payload. This is the delivery of the toxin to the cancer cell. So we already had a HER2 antibody drug conjugate, as these are called, called TDM1. And that drug, Katsyla, was really a big improvement in the treatment of hertipositor breast cancer. We use it in more resistant early stage disease and in the metastatic setting. And the idea was a smart bomb. The antibody would bind to the receptor, which you see here as one in this picture. The cell is very smart. binds to a receptor, it internalizes the complex of the receptor and the antibody drug conjugate. And inside the cell, the body will cleave the linker releasing this nasty toxin to kill the cancer cell. And one of the things about TDM1 is that the toxin here was actually not very water soluble, so it didn't leak out so much. But the idea is with these new water soluble toxins and that you could put twice as many of the drug onto the antibody, called the drug to anybody ratio, you might be able to kill neighboring cells that weren't hurt you positive. Turns out that that's a very superficial understanding of this. And that even though the drug is targeted to hurt two, it seems to be able to work even in cancers that are not hereto positive and have very little her two of the receptors on the surface of the cancer cell. So the toxin here is called a topo isomerase 1 inhibitor. It's a way of killing cancer cells, we don't give drugs other than that outside of antibody drug conjugates that have this mechanism of action except for in these antibody drug conjugates, at least for breast cancer. For other cancers, like colon cancer, these drugs are, and leukemia, these drugs are given quite commonly. So there was an original study that was done testing this drug and Hereto or TDXD in patients who had hormone receptor positive breast cancer, but not Hurt2 positive, where TDXD or in HART2 is dramatically better even than CADSILA or TEM1. So in Hurtu positive disease in the metastatic breast cancer, Inher2, or TDXT, is really, really very effective. We give it after our first line of chemotherapy, but there is a study that should report out results by the end of the year, we hope, that has looked at it as the first treatment for metastatic hert-2-positive breast cancer. We just don't have the results yet. So this trial said, well, you know, we saw some benefit in patients who didn't have H-2-Positive breast cancer, but they had a little H-2-2 on their cancer cell called H-2-Low. Don't meet criteria for H-2-posive, but a little. So everybody had their tumor sent in centrally, and they confirmed that it was H-2-2 a little bit positive, called 1-plus or 2-plus, but not 3-plus or positive. And so they randomized patients who, They'd received their hormone therapy, their CDK-4-6 inhibitors, whatever else they were going to get. Hormone therapy was no longer an option. And then they got one line of another chemotherapy, one or two. And about halfway through about half of them, one had gotten one line of chemo. Then they compared inherit two to other chemotherapy drugs, and about half of the patients received the chemotherapy drug, aeribulin. What they found was that TDXD improved the duration of disease control, we call progression-free survival. and it almost doubled it. You can see it went from 4.2 to 9.6 months in terms of how long cancer was controlled. And that it also improved survival for patients. So that's a really big, important endpoint for our patients. And you can see that the survival improved as well out to about two years in these patient population. And a lot of people lived much longer than that, of course. You can see that there are people still living way far out. It's just that the follow up for this trial was relatively short, and this is the median, so halfway through. So the drug got FDA approved, the U.S. FDA approved for her too low metastatic breast cancer after one prior chemotherapy for her too low disease. But the trial was mostly testing the drug in patients who had hormone receptor positive disease, but there was a tiny component of patients with triple negative breast cancer, and so the FDA approved it for both groups of patients. But then we saw some data from a small trial from Europe that even patients who had no her two on their cancer cell, her two, zero, also seemed to have a benefit. So about four months of response until their cancer started progressing in patients, you know, 837 patients who got TDXD and didn't have even her too low disease. And, you know, this is the curve for how long the disease control was. It was quite reasonable for these patients. So the question was, could TDXD work in patients who hadn't gotten any chemo for hormone receptor positive disease just had hormone therapy and hormone therapy and targeted agents no longer were working to control the cancer? And a second question was could it work in patients who weren't even hurt too low? So they just have a little bit of hurt you on the cancer cell, but not zero. So somewhere between what we would call zero and zero. one plus. And this is looking at an antibody with a brown color under a microscope. So it could be one in a thousand cells. It's not one plus, but it's called the term was coined ultra low. So if you look at the population of patients with hormone receptor positive disease, we're not looking at triple negative here. About two thirds have her two low. All hurt you negative. So they're not in the classic category of her two positive. About two thirds have her too low. but an extra 20 to 25% would fit into this ultra-low group. So that would represent about 85% many patients with hormone receptor positive disease, which is the most common category of breast cancer in both early and late stage disease in the entire world. So it's a big, big issue. So this data was presented at ASCO. So it was a late-breaking abstract. They made a special session at 7.30 in the morning just for it with a disgust. And so this trial was called Destiny Breast 06. So the population of patients, these are patients who had not received any chemotherapy for metastatic breast cancer, but they had to have disease that the investigator, a doctor, provider thought, was no longer responsive to endocrine therapy. Patients who were on this trial had received a median of two lines of endocrine therapy, and most 90% had a CDK-4-6 inhibitor like Ibrans, Verzhenio, Kiskali. They were randomized to receive TDXD or inherit to or treat. treatment of physician choice and about 50%, a little more than 50%, receives alota or cap cytobine because it's oral and you don't have hair loss. So the primary question was what happens in her two low disease? 713 patients had her two low disease, again confirmed by a central pathology group. But 153 had this her two that we normally would have called zero, not one plus or two plus, but not zero. So they wanted to look and see how this worked. And this group, the ultra low, was a secondary outcome. So just sort of a question, will it work or not? So they had a lot more patients who were still on treatment at their data cutoff. The median time that they were able to follow patients was a year and a half, so that's really good. And the patients who had the her two ultra low looked very similar to the patients who had her too low. They all had, I mentioned the median two lines of prior chemotherapy. And interestingly, in this group of patients, we see a lot of patients who are going on to Cape Cidabiner's Elota, and they only have cancer in their bones, nowhere else we call it bone-only disease, or bone and soft tissue, like fluid in the lung, around the lung. But in this group of patients, only 3% had bone-only disease. Most of them had cancer in the lungs or liver. About two-thirds had liver, and that probably has to do with who we want to give intravenous therapy to, and who really was eligible, according to the patient and the provider, discussion for randomization on this trial. What they showed was that Inheritio, compared to treatment of physician choice, where more than 50% received Zoloda, was better. There was a five-month median improvement in the time until the cancer started to grow again. And there's a big range here. You can see, these are all estimated. In the group of patients who had, again, her two low disease, they looked at survival, but although there's a trend here, it's not. significant at all, and about a fifth of the patients who got the Zoloda or other chemo first went on to get an her-two-second. So we don't know whether it's better to get it first or second yet. We're going to have to need longer follow-up to know if the survival will differ if you got it first or second. They also looked at this group that were hurt to ultra-low, 153 patients, and we saw almost the same degree of benefit in the duration of the... disease control. Again, we don't know about survival yet. But it is really remarkable because these patients barely have any hurt to you on their cancer cells. How does the anybody get into the cell? You know, it doesn't need much to get there. And there's a lot of leakage of the toxin that's attached to the anybody around. So there also was better shrinkage of cancer cells. They refer to that as overall response rate. And it worked in patients who had cancer again in liver and lung. And whether or not they received Zalota, it seemed to work the best in the patient population who had Zillota, that's Cape Cidabine here. Maybe, you know, it's hard to know about the people who got taxol or a brachshane, but it definitely worked if you had liver metastases. And I think this is an interesting question because we don't really know if it's, you know, going to be better than Cap Cidabine and people who have bone-only disease. What are the side effects? Nausea is the most common side effect for TDXT. Most patients do not lose their hair, but we see hair thinning, and some people do lose their hair, so we always have to warn patients, but it's a small number, about 30%. In the initial studies here, about 45%, but most of them were hair thinning, not complete loss of hair. We don't see a lot of drop in blood counts. It's not common, and the number of patients who have significant drop in blood counts is less than a fifth of the patients. The biggest issue that we've always been concerned about is inflammation of the lung, and that's called interstitial pneumitis, an interstitial lung disease or pneumitis. And the rate here is about what we've seen in breast cancer 11 to 12%. Most of the patients, if you get up to grade two, which means symptoms and changes on a CT scan of your chest, you have to stop the drug. And you can see overall that was 9% of patients. The patients who have just no symptoms, but changes on their CT scan, usually can be retreated after the changes on the CT scan go away. And they can, can be retreated safely. Three patients died. So it's unfortunate to see that. We don't want to have anybody die from our treatment. These three patients all had complications. They were all older. One patients got treated with an abnormal CT scan. And two patients had other complications. So we're hopeful that with ongoing treatment, we're going to be able to prevent the deaths from this pneumitis. And you need to have CT scans at least every nine weeks to start with in order to look for these changes. So the ultra-low is very, you know, this is a huge population of patients where we can benefit patients where TDXD was better. We don't know the survival data yet, so we need to follow this. And we can treat patients who have a very low number of her two positive cells, ultra-low. And so our pathologists are now referring to this as zero-to-one plus, but there isn't a universal assessment yet. So you could consider that patients who have a lot of disease in the low, liver or lungs could be good candidates for having TDXD or in hair to as their first chemotherapy treatment. Patients who have bone and soft tissue disease and they've had long responses to hormone therapy and have, you know, really lived a long time from diagnosis, you know, responded to the second hormone treatment. Those are patients where I would still recommend using Zoloda, where you have an oral drug, you can travel with no hair loss and no risk of pneumitis. So I think this is an ongoing discussion, and I'm very interested in my colleague's thoughts on this. So who would like to talk to? Well, I completely agree with you that this, again, is really individual patient dependent. The benefit is there in terms of first-line treatment. We're seeing greater responses, longer duration of disease. control, but I think we need longer follow-up and the overall survival. We don't know that if you get in the second line, your long, long-term, like what we call the PFS2, right, the time for the second progression could be similar whether you get it first or second. So I think that it's great. We've got more options to give, but I think the quality of life is a critical point in here, which we haven't seen that. data yet. I think the fact that cap cytobine is an oral regimen that allows more flexibility and no hair loss. I think there are clear advantages to staying with cap cytobine in patients who have slower growing disease, not less symptomatic where you, you know, because the goal is to keep patients on this first line for a long time. right, hopefully more than a year or close to a year. And you have to think about, okay, if our goal is to keep them on for as long as possible, do we want that to be an IV chemotherapy where they may lose more hair and other side effects associated with IV therapy? So it's a long way of saying. I agree that for some patients, TDXD first line makes sense. if we need to get a response quickly because patients are symptomatic. We know that we will get higher chance of a response and potentially a deeper response faster. So I think that's a great option. But I think for many patients where it's slower growing, I'm not sure that the quality of life is going to be better and we have to see what those data show. Yes, and then the interstitial lung disease, how worried are you about that, Laura? Yeah, so I think ILD is definitely an issue with this drug, as Dr. Rugo mentioned, about the trial show about 11 to 12 percent of patients can have interstitial lung disease. I think we have gotten better at monitoring for this, and so as was mentioned, we get scans every nine weeks. And so I think very important at a patient to be aware of the risk of pneumitis and look out for if you develop a cough or shortness of breath or any kind of respiratory symptoms to let your doctor know right away. because once we know about it, we give steroids to sort of calm down the immune reaction, and that really helps improve outcomes and keep people from developing these fatal complications. And so I think we have gotten better at educating patients to let us know, and then for us being aware of that, monitoring for it. But I think it is a real issue with this drug that is ongoing. I'm hopeful that over time we'll have better biomarkers to try to help. you know, which are the patients that develop more ILD? Can we predict that and maybe avoid it in those patients or other ways to monitor it in a better way to help, you know, select which patients to give this to? But for now it is really a monitoring and symptom-based approach and catching it early is really key. This is great, and we're already four minutes over time. We had lots of other things to talk about, so maybe we'll be able to talk to you about them more at our next conference. I just wanted to go through and see if, make sure everybody saw where the postings of the recordings are on the website. And that I think we've answered most of the questions in the Q&A. We really appreciate everybody's interest in discussions. And, oh, I'm just going to answer this one question from Lynn that three patients died during the CT scan. No, that one of the patients had a CT scan that showed the interstitial needs. lumenitis on the scan. But the team, somewhere internationally, by report, this is all verbal report, didn't see the scan until after she received another dose of the drug. And that patient eventually died from complications. We don't treat when patients already have an abnormality on their CT scan. It can be hard. I mean, we're always struggling with this. But, you know, is that real? Is it a, is it due to asthma or COVID or viral infection? But anyway, we're always working on this. One of our patients who's on did mention that she got interstitial lung disease after just one dose and presumably symptomatic and had to go off drug, which is really such a shame. And we hope through the research that's going on to really identify which patients are at risk and also how to treat patients who had already got symptoms associated with interstitial lung disease safely. There's a lot of work going on in this area. So we're excited about this. And this is just one antibody drug conjugate. It's the one that started. It has the broadest efficacy, I think, with the, even with this lung disease, the least side effects. But we are, you know, really interested in all of the other ones. There's another one that's approved, Sassetucamab or Trudevian, many others that have exciting early or later data. So you're going to hear more and more about them as we move them into early stage disease. So last comment? Kelsey, any comment to the community? No, I think this was great. Thank you so much for all the great discussion and all of your engagement. So, likewise, I think, as you're seeing, lots of exciting research going on in the field. I mean, drugs are getting approved for breast cancer faster than ever, especially in ER positive. Well, actually, all subtypes, ER positive, her two negative, triple negative, and, her too positive. It's really incredible. And Laura. Yeah, and I think it's just so wonderful to see so many of you logged on to learn about these updates. I think it's really wonderful to then be able to ask your doctors about these treatments and how it applies to you, I think, is really individualized. But I think we're so lucky at EUSIF have to have so patients that are so interested and engaged in kind of learning the latest and greatest. And so many of patients that want to be on clinical trials and kind of try these newer agents, which we think are really, really promising. So just love working with all of the patients and great to see you guys tonight. Any last comments? Yeah. Thank you guys so much for joining. And I think this is great because, you know, a lot of breast cancer is about personalized care to the patient. So to you as a patient advocate or a patient in our audience here, it's really great to know that you guys are, you know, getting this information so that you can better move. more better like informed decisions about your own care because sometimes there are some ambiguity. There are some potential alternatives. And I think doing this and educating yourself and seeing what's new in the research is really beneficial for you, your family members, and just the community. Thanks so much. And I don't think Michael's on, but he's just his avatar. But I really appreciate everybody joining somebody. Asked how many people were on. We had, I think, close to 70 people at some point. we really appreciate everybody joining your support of the program, all of your questions and comments, and we look forward to you at the next forum, which will be posted on our website. We don't quite have the date yet. Sorry about that, but we will continue to review new data. And I, of course, on my side, I'm so grateful for my colleagues for volunteering in their busy day and evening to work on this and educate everyone. So thanks very much again. Take care. Good night. Thank you.",
