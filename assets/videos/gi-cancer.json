  "text": " Hello again, and welcome back to the Oncology Brothers podcast. I'm Rohit Ghasein, and along with my brother and co-host, Mark Lewis, we are bringing you the most significant updates from ASCO 2024. Okay, I'll still have Rahul as my co-host, but I'm thrilled to welcome our third Oncology Brother, Dr. Mark Lewis, to cover key studies in GI malignancies from ASCO 2024. Mark, thank you so much for joining us. Well, thank you, gentlemen. And as I've told you many times, you make me feel very included as an actual only child. I get the sense of what it would be like to have a supportive sibling growing up. And in all seriousness, this was just a wonderful meeting as we were just discussing, you know, so much progress really across the board. We'll certainly talk about highlights and GI, but I really always come back to these conferences with renewed hope. And it's also wonderful to see for our patients and for our colleagues that the field gets better all the time. As we'll discuss, that actually poses really some problems when designing trial schemas these days, because you essentially know as the investigator that the standard of care might progress while your study is ongoing. That will certainly come up a couple of times today, but that is, to me, a nice problem to have. Indeed. First things first, Mark, I'm glad you feel included, but I have to be honest, you and Eric Senge make me very insecure. I feel like Rohit would swap me out with one of you in a heartbeat. Okay, we're not here for my therapy session, so let's put that aside and get started with some key abstracts that caught our attention. Starting off with one of the plenary discussions, the S-EPEC study. Before we go any further in this study, Mark, it is important to acknowledge what our standard of care has been for esophageal adenocarcinoma, which is concurrent chemoradiation followed by surgery and then use of immunotherapy if there is residual disease. or periop-flat followed by surgery. Historically, the concurrent chemoradiation approach has been heavily used in the community settings, whereas flat has been more actively given or used in academic settings. With that in mind, Mark, your thoughts on SFX study? Yeah, thank you so much. It was rather remarkable to see this lead off the plenary session. So, one of what ASCO deemed to be the five studies that deserve the most prominence at this meeting. And while I do think this moves the field forward, I think this study actually falls victim a little bit to the problem I was just discussing methodologically, which is that arguably some of our standards of care for upper GI cancer have evolved during the period of time that this study was maturing. And again, the investigators should not be faulted for that. So really briefly, I have to give you some of my background, which is that CROSS actually was published when I was a fellow in oncology. And I remember just how, if you'll forgive the expression, although I think it's justified game-changing, that regimen was for our patients with esophageal cancer. My attendings and fellowship really impressed upon me just what a leap forward it was. And now more than a decade later, because that was 2012, it's amazing to see that now, you know, CROSS is being used really as the control arm here. And we're asking the question, does perioperative chemotherapy actually improve outcomes? The biggest, I think, study to recognize as a predecessor here is NeoAges. That was actually already asking the question of whether perioperative chemo would be superior to CROSS. But the major criticism, and arguably a justified one of neo-Ageist, is that it happened during a time when the winds of change were blowing. So we were moving away from the horrible epiribicin-based triplets of the magic era and towards FLOT. And again, I'll point out, it's kind of remarkable to see how quickly things changed. just a few years ago at ASCO GI, there was an incredibly heated debate called flood or not, which was asking the question, can our patients with upper GI cancer even tolerate a perioperative triplet? And I think that this study again shows that many of them can, but this actually brings me into my first sort of major caveat. When I was sitting in the plenary audience, the first thing that struck me was it seemed to me that CROSS was less tolerable for this study population than you might expect, even based on the historical precedent that really was established more than a decade ago when you think that maybe supportive care wasn't as good. So if you look at how they sort of measured completion, more than 90% of the patients who were receiving preoperative FLOT were able to complete the regimen. I'll point out for a second, though, and this does not surprise me, only half of the patients in the FLOT arm then made it to postoperative therapy, meaning that they healed up enough in time for adjuvant. And that is kind of what we've seen previously, like in FLOP4. But what struck me as odd is that in the cross arm, roughly two-thirds of the patients were able to complete their treatment. And the reason I find that strange is cross, to me, actually has a huge advantage in terms of tolerability. And this really, I don't think, was adequately fleshed out even in the discussion at Plenary. But as it turns out, subsequent comments from the investigators have really clarified just how strictly they were counting completion. So when you're doing the cross arm, of course, you're getting carboplatin and paclitaxel at relatively modest doses weekly during radiation as sensitizers. And it turns out that if you missed a single dose of the platinum or taxine anywhere during the course of radiation therapy, that they would count that as not completed. That's a pretty high bar, actually, to clear because it's pretty common to run into, say, thrombocytopenia after all those consecutive weeks of those drugs. So I think that probably explains the imbalance. But all told, what this really tells us is that right now, I think we can offer in good conscience perioperative FLOT to patients who qualify, realizing that most of that benefit is going to come from the preoperative FLOT. And then finally, and this is the other reason I'm not quite ready to switch everybody over to FLOT, Dr. Karen Goodman in her plenary discussion raised the excellent point that the other trial that we need to think about that, again, matured while this one was being run is Checkmate 577. So now it's extremely common that we would offer adjuvant immunotherapy if there was any residual disease in the esophagectomy specimen. And the synergy that we might then discern between the radiation that we have in CROSS and the immunotherapy that follows thereafter, I think, is actually quite compelling. So watch this space. This trial was important. I do think it deserved plenary discussion. I think there are a few methodological questions that are still being answered. And I think we really need to see how this looks in the era of adjuvant, say, nivolumept. Thanks for covering that, Mark. And again, very important points that you mentioned. But in addition to that something that was also is that Patsy R in Azopec was much lower in concurrent chemoradiation versus historically seen in CROSS Now you add that to nivolumab that only going to add more benefit But again I was hoping that we would walk away from a clear winner, which we can start utilizing in our community practice. Yes, peri-off-flot is the current standard of care, at least based on the results, and we'll talk about the results, but again, where do you see chemoradiation or cross regimen fit in exactly? Would you consider that for a frail patient or a node-negative patient still being utilized? That's an excellent point, and you basically sort of foresaw my answers. Yes, I actually view all the completion caveats aside, I do view cross as more tolerable, generally speaking, and again, that might be my bias as a medical oncologist, because in real well practice, it's not uncommon that we would withhold chemotherapy if we were running into cytopenias. And again, the investigators obviously had a very strict protocol to adhere to. I think, again, to invoke Dr. Goodman, she made the excellent point that maybe we're actually looking at two completely different outcomes here. To your point about nodal involvement, I think FLOT is an excellent systemic regimen. I really, really do. However, I think CROSS, its advantage is probably more to be found in terms of local regional control. And as you just said, you know, the PAT-CR may not even be the goal. If we have residual viable tumor, then presumably there's some substrate or new epitopes there for, you know, stimulating immunotherapy and endogenous immunity thereafter. So again, you're right. This absolutely did not answer the questions. To answer your community question though, if oncologists still have access to a tumor board, and I realize that is a luxury, that's not necessarily the case everywhere. I think we now have the case with esophageal and GE junction adenocarcinoma that multidisciplinary input up front is so helpful. It's really, really starting to follow, if it hadn't already, the rectal paradigm, where if you're not thinking about rectal cancer with your radiation oncology and your surgical oncology colleagues, you may frankly be undertreating or underplanning. So this, to me, really raised the importance of these cases being discussed up front, especially perhaps with radiation oncology, because obviously their involvement is going to be absolutely integral to following the CROSS protocol. I want to stress the importance of the multidisciplinary, as we will see in future studies as well, that we'll be discussing, that it is extremely important to involve our surgical colleagues as well as radiation oncology colleagues. Though in terms of the results, PFS and OS from this Azovpec trial seems convincing, but again, deciding on patient therapy approach and having patient in mind is extremely important. Now, moving along to our next study here, Armani's study. For metastatic GEJ and gastric cancer, our current treatment options are chemo IO in PD-L1 positive patients and adding anti-HER2 therapy if HER2 positive patient. We are eagerly waiting on the antibody targeting CLAUDIN 18.2. But in patient that is not eligible for IO or anti-HER2 treatment, our current option remains chemotherapy. With that in mind, Mark, your thoughts on Armani's study. Yeah, well, first of all, proof that it's not just the breast oncologist or lung oncologist that can come up with good trial acronyms. So we're getting there. Probably my favorite study acronym in the GI space at ASCO 24. So again, we're living through a sea change in upper GI cancer. I so vividly remember it was the first half of 2021, which, of course, was a horrendous and harrowing time for so many people in health care. And yet, I think in the first half of that year, we had something like five new drug approvals in the upper GI space. It was just absolutely mind-blowing. However, most of the advances recently have been, as you inferred, biomarker-driven. We are getting better at splitting, not lumping, and when we split by biomarker status, we can then offer people kind of more targeted therapy. This, to me, is really looking at the patients that, to date, had not been benefiting from these biomarker-driven approaches, HER2 negative. of, as you mentioned, this is not looking at IO, nor is it looking at, you know, say anti-clot and 18.2 approaches like we might soon get with zolbatuximab. So maybe this is a study partly of its time. However, it's still important to realize just kind of the uphill battle that we're still fighting in upper GI cancer for all these recent successes. The big sort of raison d'etre for this trial, I think, is the fact that about 40% of patients who have locally advanced or metastatic upper GI cancer, they're not getting to second line chemotherapy. And so the question was, you know, is your sort of first shot your best one and you never get a second chance to make a first impression? Or is it better to switch partly in an effort to reduce toxicity? So in this study, I think it's important to know that these patients had three months of run-in with either Folfox or Kapox or pretty hefty oxali some before they were randomized. And then they were randomized to ram-paclitaxel or continuing the same platinum and fluoroprimidine doublet. I'll also point out, there's a study predecessor here that's important to mention where we've previously looked at the addition of ramacirumab to a platinum and 5-FU backbone, and it didn't seem to have the activity that we wanted. So that, I think, makes this schema more sensible. What was striking to me actually here was the toxicity. You know, oxaliplatin to me as a oncologist, is probably the drug I treat the most carefully in terms of its cumulative dosing. So up front, I would have thought that the patients who switched to RAM-paclitaxel might have actually had less neuropathy. But it turns out, as we can discuss in the final analysis, that was not the case. I know we'll get to the prime ramp points of survival. But to me, the question was, well, what does the toxicity profile look like? Because things have to be tolerable before they can be effective. And again, it was kind of striking that the rates of grade three peripheral neuropathy were actually higher in the group that switched. And the rates of sort of all-comer grade three or more treatment-related adverse events were also, I think, double, I think 40% to 20% between the taxane versus the platinum arm. The only way I can explain this as a gene oncologist is I use taxanes in my practice, but not nearly as much as platinums. they actually cause different forms of neuropathy. So platinum deposits in an axonal sort of length-dependent fashion in the extremities, whereas taxanes actually work at the dorsal root ganglia. So I'm actually kind of wondering if the patients that switched, basically were getting kind of hit on both ends of the nerve, both at the nerve roots and then out in the periphery. So I'm wondering if that's why their neuropathy is worse, because that's why I found that to be a very counterintuitive adverse effect profile. So other than that though I think the investigators raised interesting questions about activity and I think maybe we discuss the survival endpoints Mark thank you for covering that I have to piggyback on the same thing This is exciting that there is some improvement in overall survival benefit here, but I think we need to do better in exposing our patients to that second-line therapy, right? The major reason to what you've brought up for us to switch from full FOX is to avoid oxaliplatin so that we can stay away from neuropathy. But with Taxol, Remesurumab, we're potentially seeing similar toxicity, central versus peripheral neuropathy. Patients had more grade three adverse events. So yes, we're seeing some overall survival benefit, but I just think we need to do better in this disease site, period. Yes. And in addition to that, I feel like now if the patient progresses, we have exhausted the first line and the second line because we can't expose them to Folfox because they're already suffering from neuropathy. So the choice is really relying on third or fourth line, which is not the most robust one to begin with. That's exactly right. I mean, it's very seldom that I have discussions with patients who, again, don't have sort of biomarker-driven treatment options that we even talk about third line therapy. It's extremely unappealing for obvious reasons. And I agree with you. This is not just about survival, although, again, credit to the investigators for trying to eke out a difference. It's also about, you know, quality of life. And I think I've said to you gentlemen in a prior recording, one of the worst things I've ever done, and it's funny how we admit our failures or remember them more than our successes, was to minimize a patient's neuropathy. I was presenting to one of my attendings during my fellowship, and he was a myeloma expert, another disease space, of course, that's really struggled with neurotoxicity. I was trying to reassure him, and I told my attending, this patient is only experiencing grade two neuropathy. I moved to, you know, continue my presentation. He stopped me in my tracks. He said, never say that again. He's like, you would not want to experience grade two neuropathy. So never, ever say only. And I think that's a fair point here too. Again, going in, if you'd asked me which group's going to have more neuropathy, I actually might've guessed it was the platinum continuation, but that's why we do studies. So I think quality of life is an important consideration here too. Absolutely. So again, coming back to this, though, there's some improvement in overall survival benefit seen with the switch therapy, we really, really, really have to be mindful of some of the side effects that come along. Exactly right. Okay, now talking about switch, let's switch gears to colorectal cancer. Yes. In the TRANSMET study here, we're looking at the feasibility of liver transplant in liver-confined disease after initial chemotherapy. I acknowledge this is a small study, but with profound results. Mark, can you elaborate on this study and your thoughts here? Yeah, I mean, truly an amazing study. When I saw this presented, it was almost too good to be true. I think the reason it might seem that way is, again, no fault of the investigators, but this is highly selective for obvious reasons. So again, a European trial, I think, occurred mostly in France, Germany, Italy. All credit to our European colleagues for even doing this. To me, like you were saying, I think it's the inclusion-exclusion criteria that really tell the tale. So obviously, they wanted to see no extra hepatic disease, which makes sense because you don't want to be reseeding the donor liver with metastases. Also, and this kind of seems like double jeopardy, but they didn't allow BRAC mutation. So again, potentially selecting for a slightly different biology. The other thing I found truly remarkable here was the prioritization that these patients were given, such that they actually received the transplant, as is shown on sort of the central schema slide, I think within two months of their final chemotherapy. So that did not allow a lot of time in a treatment hiatus for disease to blossom. And it's interesting because traditionally when I've talked to my transplant colleagues here, they actually like to have extremely long windows with no evidence of growth, obviously while on chemotherapy, but also while off of it. And so I found that the tight interval there really telling. Maybe one of the reasons this was so successful is the quick jump there. But again, to go back to the selectivity, I think this is important. So what they did in this trial, to be ethical, is they presented, again, unresectable colorectal liver metastases to this sort of expert panel and asked them to adjudicate who was appropriate for transplant. And I'll point out, I think something like 150 patients were screened up front, of which only, air quotes, 60% or so actually made it to the randomization. So again, very important study, really remarkable. I would not have expected this kind of outcome. But to replicate this in the real world, especially in the U.S., I think is going to be challenging. I think the most important thing to reiterate here is the importance of multidisciplinary approach. Yes. And when it comes to oligometastatic disease. Now, moving along to our next study, collision study here. If not transplant in limited liver disease, is surgery a better option versus ablation? Mark, your thoughts on collision study, please. Yeah, this is actually a really nice sort of beautiful segue, of course, but this is a very nice sequel to our discussion of TransMed. Once again, this is going to be maybe the broken record or the theme for our discussion today. The multidisciplinary discussion here is absolutely critical. Like I never, ever tell a patient, oh, that's ablatable or that's operable. You know, because my colleagues, both in surgery and interventional radiology, just have a remarkable way of looking at a scan and sort of planning out in their head what they're going to do procedurally. So things like not just the size of the lesion, but its proximity to vessels that can then cause heat sink effect and make thermal ablation less effective. These are things that they think about all the time that are less obvious to a medical oncologist. But this to me was also a really important study in the sense that I was hoping, which is, you know, I'll just jump to the results. I was hoping that the ablation arm would do as well, be not inferior, because to me, the patients that go through ablation and achieve some disease control in that fashion, they really have two benefits. Number one, I can imagine less delays being incurred before they can go back on systemic chemo. And number two, I tell this to my patients all the time. I say the liver to me is the organ par excellence in gynecology where disease control matters. So to me, shrinkage, instability, especially some together, are really valid endpoints because of the inherent ability of the liver to regenerate. It's truly remarkable. If we can control disease in the liver, most of our patients with metastatic colon cancer will live. So when I'm prognosticating and someone looks me right in the eyes and says, Dr. Lewis, how long am I going to live? I say listen it almost entirely predicated in this particular disease setting on preservation of your liver function and for good and bad you can feel your liver But on the other hand it got remarkable resilience The final thing I'll tell you guys, again, to invoke my fellowship days, is one of my attendings taught me very early in my training, Mark, when you're looking at a patient with colon cancer that has metastasized the liver, this was his phrase, he said, always ask yourself, are there too many weeds in the garden? And what he meant by that was, is this such overwhelming metastatic disease that not even our colleagues in surgery and interventional radiology and even Radon can help? Or is this a case where, again, you should totally be bringing these images to a tumor board or at least ad hoc to your colleagues and making sure that you're not overlooking local regional options? And so I think that's really important to emphasize here. honestly just from the community settings this is very exciting because this means that i can keep my patients close to home but coming back to exactly what you've said and what rohith has brought up that does not negate the critical aspect of multidisciplinary approach here i have to get the surgeon or the radiation oncologist to say yes i can do this so it is so important for us to bring these cases and make sure we're directing our patients for the right therapy but again this is encouraging, saying there is no clear difference in ablation or surgery. Exactly right. All right. To end, can we touch on a success story that we've seen in the world of metastatic cancer? Use of immunotherapy in mismatch-repaired disease. At GI-ASCO in January 2024, we saw data on Checkmate 8-HW, where ipinevo did way better than chemo alone. Pembrolizumab is also approved here as a single agent in metastatic colorectal cancer with MSI-high disease. In this particular study, CUMIT study, we're looking at combining atizolizumab with chemotherapy. Mark, today in your clinic, what is your practice for this particular patient population? Yeah, great question. So, first of all, kudos to the study investigators who are running this trial. Shout out to, I think, both the NRG and SWA cooperative groups that are enrolling to it. because I think it's going to be really interesting to see how this plays out. So I'll answer your question and I'll talk about the study in particular. So the biggest change in my entire gene oncology practice occurred with the publication of Keynote 177, because all of a sudden a significant minority of my metastatic colon cancer patients could be treated with immunotherapy and immunotherapy alone. I literally, and it's amazing how cases stick in your mind, I literally had a patient with metastatic disease to the liver, And I was one day away from starting her on a pretty toxic, if I'm honest, triplet of full-flexuri when it came back that she was actually a candidate for pembrolizumab. I remember calling her up and saying, hey, listen, I just found this Achilles heel, if you will, in your cancer. I really think that we should start with immunotherapy. And she's been an absolute success story. So complete resolution of disease. No immune-related adverse events. I mean, just absolutely incredible. And obviously, we're going to file that in the exceptional responder category. So the answer to your question is, if I see a vulnerability to immunotherapy in a metastatic setting, I almost always reach for pembrolizumab first. And maybe I'm just anchoring on Keynote 177. The other option, of course, that will strike us is ipilimumab and nivolumab. And you're right. The readout of Checkmate 8HW, I think, has been very telling there. To me, I'm just going to show my own bias. I'm always a little nervous to add in an anti-CTLA-4 unless I'm absolutely convinced that I need to. And so to me, Checkmate 8HW has not necessarily unseated Keynote 177. But finally, the investigators who put Commit together actually cited Keynote 177 as sort of the reason that they were even doing this study. They said, listen, yes, Keynote 177 is a huge leap forward. But at one year, 45% of patients on the pembrolizumab arm have progressed. so clearly we need to do something differently and so i think what they're doing here quite bravely is trying to see if we can combine chemo and even another biologic with immunotherapy this is pretty wild to me um i think it was the atizo tribe study actually had a quintet they had full foxery bev and tizolizumab starting to get mind-blowing we're starting to get into like myeloma regimens like but this is going to be fascinating because really what i think this is going to answer when it reads out is do we actually protect some patients with let's just use the colloquialism more aggressive disease by giving them chemotherapy up front for cell kill while we're waiting for sort of immune surveillance to kick in and i think that's what they're hoping to see from the arm that contains all these different agents because the one thing i will say about keynote 177 that's always unnerved me is there's an initial declivity in the pembro arm where clearly some patients were benefiting or one might even argue needing chemotherapy before the immunotherapy actually kicked in. In my mind, those are patients who are right on the verge of visceral crisis, say from liver metastasis. So I've always thought there is still a niche for chemo. What I'm fascinated to see when this matures is how much the benefit of the chemotherapy, the other biologic anti-BEDF agent and the immunotherapy have together. It's going to be amazing to see this. And that's what brings us to a very important point. That is, let us make sure that all these patients are tested for MSI status. We could talk about these success stories, but if we are not offering immunotherapy to these patients without testing MSI status, this is of no use. Mark, thank you so much for covering these studies with us. ASCO 2024 was certainly very exciting. For those tuning in, let us go over a brief recap. With Dr. Mark Lewis from Intermountain Health, we've covered studies including the ESOPEC trial comparing concurrent chemoradiation versus periop-flot for upper GI adenocarcinoma. Then we've touched on Armani trial on switch maintenance with bramycerumab plus paclitaxel. We also had a chance to discuss the TRANSMET trial exploring chemotherapy followed by liver transplantation for metastatic liver-confined colorectal cancer. We also discussed the collision trial comparing surgery versus thermal ablation for small size colorectal liver metastatic disease and the comet study looking at the use of atezolizumab with chemotherapy in first-line treatment for msi high metastatic colorectal cancer these studies continue to highlight the importance of biomarker testing and multidisciplinary approach thank you for tuning in make sure to check out our lung gu and breast cancer highlights from asco 2024 we are the oncology brothers Cheers.",
