  "text": " Hi, everyone. Welcome. We're just going to give maybe another minute or so for people to come on. Thank you for being here. Thank you. Hey, everyone, we will get started. Thank you for joining our Debbie's Dream Foundation webinar series. Today's webinar features Dr. Samuel Kuntner, who will give us a presentation on the 2024 ASCO and ESMO GI updates. I am Jennifer Higgins Spires, Program Manager for Debbie's Dream Foundation, and I will be moderating today's webinar. Thank you also to our generous sponsors for making this program possible. platinum sponsors Bristol-Myers Squibb, Merck, and Taiho Oncology, bronze sponsor Arcus Biosciences, silver sponsor Amgen, and copper sponsor Lily Oncology. First, I will share information about stomach cancer and Debbie Stream Foundation. Then we will hear a presentation on ASCO and ESMO updates from Dr. Clintner. And finally, a Q&A session will follow the presentation. Debbie Stream Foundation is dedicated to raising awareness, advancing funding for stomach cancer research, and providing education and support internationally to patients, families, and caregivers. Our ultimate goal is to make the cure for stomach cancer a reality. You can learn more by visiting our website at DebbieStream.org. This year, nearly 30,000 Americans will be diagnosed with stomach cancer. Semicancer is the second leading cause of cancer deaths worldwide after lung cancer with a dismal five-year survival rate between 20% and 30%, depending on the country. Many patients are asymptomatic during the early stages of stomach cancer, leading to late diagnosis. The picture here is Debbie Zellman, the founder of Debbie's Dream Foundation. Debbie was diagnosed with stage four cancer in April 2008. She had no risk factors and only vague symptoms. At the time, she was told that her chance of being alive in five years was only 4%. Debbie founded DDF in April 2009 and dedicated herself to helping others with stomach cancer by raising awareness and providing resources and education. Simultaneously, she endured harsh chemo regimens and targeted research and targeted treatments and experienced many recurrences. Unfortunately, Debbie passed away on December 23, 2017, at the age of 50, after a nine-and-a-half-year battle with cancer. As an organization, CDF continues her important work and legacy. In a few short years, CDF has achieved many great milestones. We have chapters across the U.S., including Canada and Germany. Our prep program helps patients, their families, and caregivers match the survivors and caregiver mentors using disease-specific criteria, including stage, biomarker, and location. We host educational webinars and symposia year-round, and our website contains in-depth information about stomach cancer. We also have provided $1.45 million in research grants to date. Patient advocates come together each year at our annual Soma Cancer Capitol Hill Advocacy Day to secure funding from the Department of Defense's peer-reviewed cancer research program, which allocates funds for stomach cancer research. Earlier this year, on February 5th through 7th, we traveled to Washington, D.C. with more than 150 advocates and held 250 meetings with lawmakers to inform them that we need more funding for this deadly disease. We're proud to say that this year was our largest turnout yet. We hope that you join us next year as we let Congress know that we need a cure. You can type your questions throughout the presentation onto the chat section that appears in the webinar menu. We will address the questions at the conclusion of the presentation as time allows. Dr. Plettner is an associate professor at Massachusetts General Hospital and Harvard Medical School and leads the gastric and esophageal program. His clinical and translational research is centered on cancer genomics, acquired resistance to targeted therapies, and the intersection of genomics and immune-mediated therapies to identify novel therapeutic approaches in biomarkers and gastroesophageal cancers. He serves as the NRG Non-Colorectal Committee, co-chairs the NCI Esophageous Task Force, and is on the NCCN Guideline Committees for Gastrocnosophageal Cancers. His work is supported by Stand Up to Cancer, the NCI and IH, the AACR, and the Graverio Foundation, the Gastric Cancer Foundation and Gateway to Cancer Research. He is active in the gastric and esophageal cancer outreach and patient advocacy. So now I will hand it over to Dr. Kuttner. And thanks for your time. Thanks, Jen. Always a great reminder to hear how much work you guys are doing and all the money that you've put back into research, not to mention, you know, all the patients you've helped. Let me try to get this going. So I think I got about 40 minutes of talking, and then we'll have time for as many questions as we can get to. If there's questions, you know, put them in the chat, and Jen will be there. We'll make sure we get to as many as we can. I focused this on updates from ASCO and ESMO GI. Sorry, I'm just going to go off camera because it's lagging for me. All right, yeah, that's more better. These are my disclosures. I'll start with the punchlines. So really big deal from ASCO, a little bit more for esophagus than stomach, But we now have a new standard of care. Used to give a lot of chemo plus radiation, and that's really no longer the preferred approach because flocked, which is tough, is the preferred standard. It prolongs people's lives and cures more patients. We're really getting better. I know that finding ways to avoid this really tough operation is one of the messages we hear loud and clear from patients. It's been really hard to find ways to avoid this surgery so far, but INFINITY is one trial that may offer a path to no surgery for some patients. Renaissance is addressing one of the other big questions, which is, you know, I have a stage four cancer. Can you cut it all out? And we hear that a lot, too. And it's a discussion that's probably, you know, near to many patients. And this trial gives us some evidence to say that, you know, we really need to think hard about this because if you don't select people, then it doesn't help. Armani is not just a fancy name of some clothes. I don't know anything about clothes, but it's about not making sure we don't miss the opportunity to give people all the tools that we have. Keynote 585 and Keynote 811 are two different pembrolizumab studies. 585 is asking whether we should add immune therapy for stage 2 and 3 patients. And we haven't been able to prove that yet, but we're getting closer, I think. Keynote 811 is adding immunotherapy on top of HER2 therapy. And again, it's mostly about patient selection. Spotlight and GLOW, which you've probably heard about, are trials about zolidotuximab and Claudein-18. And this drug should be approved finally in November of this year, we expect, when the FDA meets. And then we'll talk about some other targets, FGFR-2B, TIGIT, MET, a lot of cool stuff. So a lot of hope for the future. I'm going to jump right into it, and there's a lot of data in here. I'll try to go through it. but for the longest time people used to debate whether we should do FLOT or CROSS. And again, this is really more higher tumors like stomach esophagus junction and higher up in the esophagus. And there was like two teams. One team was like we should give chemoradiation. That was called CROSS. And the other team was like we should give chemotherapy, which is FLOT. And there was no clear winner, and these had never been â€“ The teams had never kind of played each other, so we didn't really know who was the winner. So it really goes back to, like, unfortunately, why do our patients die? Well, people with stage 2 and 3 disease, they usually pass away from recurrent cancer. Cancer comes back in the abdomen, in the liver, et cetera. And why does that happen? If the surgeon removed everything, why does the cancer come back? Well, probably because they removed everything they can see, but what they can't see is microscopic cancer cells hiding in other places, whether it's already the liver or already the lymph nodes. And so if you don't give good enough chemotherapy or targeted therapy or immune therapy, you're not going to kill that microscopic stuff. And that's probably why our therapies were not really leading towards more cures. So the more we can do that, the more cures. That's the thinking. That's really the idea behind all this. So the Germans did this study where they compared the two teams head-to-head. The FLOT team, which is really intensive chemotherapy, as some of you probably know, versus the CROSS team, which is lighter-dose chemotherapy combined with radiation. and patients got randomized one-to-one meaning 50 50 to chemo before surgery or chemo radiation before surgery and the surgery people who only got chemo they have to get chemo on the back end after surgery just like we do for true stomach cancers and the goal of this was to see who lived longer who did we cure more patients and so i'll go through these parts quickly but it just goes to tell you that these are not like trial only patients. These are people who we see in the real world. You know, these are people like you all listening. These are advanced cancers. Most of these people had lymph node involvement at the time. So mostly stage three patients. And this is the punchline. So the red line is the chemo people and the blue line is the chemo radiation team. And it's hard to see like this, but every one of those vertical tick marks that you can probably see on my arrow, that's a patient. So every time a patient dies, that's called censored. And so one of these tick marks happen, and then there's less people alive. So you start with 100% of people alive, and then over time, unfortunately, less and less people are alive. And the numbers are below, which is called the risk table. And so you see that more people are alive at essentially every time point if you pick one year there's more people on the red line 172 versus 146 if you pick four years out from from diagnosis there's more people on the red line you see it comes across at like 50 60 percent as opposed to the blue line which is down here around 40 and then you like average this out essentially and so you get a median and the median survival is now over five years, so 66 months. That's great. That's the best we've seen so far for esophageal cancer. And you see the difference down here, about 50% of people were alive five years out. So that's when we think about cures. So we start to think about, you know, curing 50% of people with this approach with chemo, as opposed to chemo radiation, which only cured like 38% of patients. So this is a big deal from ASCO, and this is probably the biggest deal from ASCO for stomach and esophagus cancers. So take home is that, you know, when you go see if you've got a new diagnosis, you've got a family member, a friend that just got diagnosed, and someone's telling them, oh, chemo and radiation is what we want to do. Well, that's probably not the answer. They might not have been aware of this data yet because it just happened in ASCO. But, you know, the more you know, the better questions you can ask. And so chemo is tough. You know, FLOT is hard, but it does give you the best chance of cure. So the tradeoff is more intense chemo, better chance of cure. So really the message is, you know, ask. If someone says chemo radiation, you should ask why, you know, why not FLOT? that's really the take home from this piece. So I talked about some people having no surgery. This is a really busy slide and people can look through it on their own. But essentially, they took people with stage two and three disease who were MSI high or MMR deficient. So if you get diagnosed with a new stomach cancer, you should immediately know what your MMR or MSI status is. It's either going to be MSI high or not, or mismatch repair deficient or proficient. The reason is that deficient patients respond exceptionally well to immune therapy. So this is a study where none of the patients got any chemotherapy. They got one dose of combination immunotherapy, and then they got a single doses of like PD-1, in this case, dervalumab. And what they did is they were able to avoid surgery in the vast majority of these patients. And that's because they had such good responses to the immunotherapy that when they did scans and when they did endoscopies and biopsies, there was really no tumor visible or seen on biopsy And those people did not have surgery And so that turned out to be most of the patients You see this pie graph over here Only the orange people went to surgery The gray people is called non management or NOM And this is no surgery. So out of all these people, it's only a small slice to the pie that needed to go to an operation. This is now part of the NCCN guidelines because of studies like this. This trial was called INFINITY. And, again, the message here is make sure you get tested for MSI or MMR because you might actually be able to avoid surgery because stomach cancer surgery is a very big deal. It will change your life probably forever. And so the more people we can figure out ways to safely avoid surgery, the better. All right. So those were the two big updates from ESMO. That INFINITY trial was ESMO. The SOPEC trial was ASCO. those were updates for stage two and three patients. The rest of the time, we're going to be talking about stage four patients because sadly, that's most of our patients. This is sort of a reminder, and it's kind of a sad reminder that we really should probably be taking our best shot for treatment in the beginning because a lot of patients, unfortunately, because of the cancer don't even get a chance to get second line or third line therapy. So as a reminder, if you get stage four, the first chemo you get is called first line, then the second chemo is called second line, and the third one is third line, and I think you get it. So this funnel over here is just my diagram. If you take 100 people that walk in my office or anyone's office with new stomach cancer, about 10 of them are not going to be candidates for any therapy. They're too sick. They don't want to do it, et cetera. So you're left with about 90 people. Those people will all get first line, and eventually most of them will develop a resistance and need to change to another treatment. But unfortunately, almost half of those people, because of their cancer, not any fault of their own, because of their cancer, they won't be able to get any more therapy. So that's one of the reasons we want to use our best treatments in the beginning. And then only about half of those people will go on to get third line therapy or more. And some of the main reasons are highlighted over here in these pictures. You know, we have people that get ascites and it sort of impacts your ability to eat, nutrition, discomfort, etc. People lose a lot of muscle mass and they become frail and just very fatigued. Sorry, I had to get this stupid battery diagram, but you have to go with things that aren't copyrighted. So stage four, just as a reminder, the first step when you get diagnosed with stage four disease, well, one of the first steps is to get all the biomarkers. Because the more tools and the more information we have about your tumor, the better chance we have of picking the right therapy. So MMR or MSI testing is critical. HER2 testing is also critical. And PD-L1 testing is very important. If I do this lecture again after November, I'll probably have another one on here that says CLAWDN testing because it will be approved. And then places that do research do a lot of additional testing, like DNA sequencing from the blood and from the tissue for additional targets that may be related to clinical trials, et cetera, like MET or some of these other ones from NCCN. So the first update, which was from ASCO oral session, was a trial called Renaissance. And it's a busy picture over here, but essentially they took people who had new diagnoses of stage four and had what was called a limited amount of metastatic disease. So when we look at someone's scans for stage four, some people have, you know, 15 spots in the liver and 10 spots in the lung and spots in the bones. And unfortunately, that is not limited. That's a high amount of cancer. We treat everybody the same, but we do look at the scans. And some people might have stage four because they only have one spot in the liver. And those are the kind of people who went on this trial. So essentially what they did is they said, okay, we're going to give you two months of chemo. They gave people four doses of FLOT. We usually do full Fox plus immunotherapy or something in the United States, but they did FLOT in Germany. Then they got scans. and if you didn't progress so if your tumor was stable or smaller then you got randomly assigned to either surgery followed by more chemo or just continue chemo so continuation of chemo would be the standard thing we call that the control arm and the experimental arm or the new thing is surgery followed by more chemo then they followed up people for survival and so this is what they called limited metastatic disease. So you see it's very detailed. So liver, you had to have maximum of five lesions that could be removed or lung. It could only be on one side and it had to be potentially resectable. If it was on the ovary, you had to have no gross peritoneal carcinomatosis, so disease throughout the lining of the abdomen. So it's very important that they selected people and didn't just offer this to everyone because we know that people who have, unfortunately, just cancer in a lot of locations, you know, surgeons never going to be able to get that all out. So it doesn't help the patients to do surgery. These are the people, just so you can see, who actually went on to this trial. You can see that about 35%, about 30% of people, it was liver that was getting them on. About one out of four patients, it was disease in the peritoneum that was limited. And then you see some tumors on the ovary and a smattering of other stuff. And this is the take-home message. And so I think it's kind of a warning sign. You know, if you shop around and you see enough surgeons and enough oncologists, like, you might find someone who will offer you an operation. But the question is, does it even help you? Is that the right thing? So in this trial, if you offered it to everybody who went on the study, it actually didn't help people live longer. They did not live longer with the addition of surgery. In fact, just continuing chemo was better. And one of the reasons we think about that is that you have to interrupt chemo to do surgery. Some people have complications from surgery, and so you can't get chemo after. And then if you have any cancer left over, it kind of just comes back. So those are not good things. And people who continue chemo don't have that problem. So their chemo doesn't get interrupted. so their cancer doesn't have a chance to act up. We always look to see if we can find clues. This is called subgroup analysis. And so people who had only lymph nodes in the retroperitoneum, the blue line is surgery. So you see that actually here, patients with surgery were doing okay. And so maybe if you only have lymph node disease that makes you stage four, Or maybe we should think about surgery periodically. And you see, you know, these people lived substantially longer, three years survival, 45% versus 20%. So there, you know, something to think about. Liver metastases, maybe not such a good idea. And unfortunately, peritoneal metastases with surgery only, probably a bad idea. And so this makes the surgical discussions a little more evidence-based and helpful for us. It doesn't address questions like HIPEC or PIPEC, which are important things. And who knows, you know, maybe with some of those strategies, some of these peritoneal disease curves would be better. We don't know the answer to that yet. But just doing surgery for people with stage four disease is probably not a catch-all fix. It doesn't help a lot of people. In fact, it may harm some people compared to just continuing chemo. So we really need to be careful and think through these types of decisions because surgery is no joke. All right, Armani. Armani is an Italian study. and essentially they were asking a pretty straightforward question. So they took people who had new stage four. They gave them a couple months of chemotherapy. So Folfox or Kapox, that's starting over there on the left side of this picture. And then as long as their disease did not grow, so they either could have stable disease or partial response, they then switched them either to continuation, which is what we would normally do. So that's arm B is called the control arm. And those people, just after their few months of Folfox, they continued Folfox. Whereas the other people, they switched over to Taxol plus Ramiserumab early, not at the time when they developed resistance, but early on. And so trials like this, which are called switch maintenance, have been done in lung cancer. and the message here is that the reason these things may work periodically is that sometimes us as oncologists and patients you know if people are doing well on like 5-FU alone and they feel okay but their tumor marker is rising or their scan is showing a little bit of growth but otherwise it's stable you know sometimes we'll just continue people on the same treatment even though we're not getting the best response that we want. And that's something that happens to all of us, but it may not be the right thing. Maybe we should just switch earlier at the first evidence or even before any resistance develops. And that was sort of an unknown question, and that's what Armani did. So they took these patients, which these are just called inclusion criteria. You don't have to memorize this at all, but basically they're people who were newly diagnosed and had some chemo but didn't have resistance yet and didn't have any severe toxicities. And this is what happened. So the primary endpoint is progression-free survival. So this is like being alive without your disease worsening or progressing. And you see the red curve is the people who switched early. and the blue curve is the people who continued the same chemo. This is obviously a good thing. This red curve is a better curve, and what this tells us is that sometimes switching chemotherapy can essentially delay the progression. It can delay resistance. If you try to fool the cancer cells by giving them different drugs, like you switch chemo every three months, you might be able to delay the development of resistant cancer cells. And that's what this does. So it delayed the time until people got resistance. But what the question that's more important is, does it actually keep people alive longer? And so that was a secondary endpoint. OS is called overall survival. And you see that the red and the blue line are a little bit closer here. There's not huge differences, but it does look that switching chemotherapy in this patient population, and none of these people got immunotherapy or HER2 therapy, so it's a smaller group of patients. You see that switching chemotherapy early actually added a couple months of survival, so not a huge difference, but certainly, you know, adding two months of life is still two months of life. And so this data, basically to me, my take home from this is that as soon as we start to think about patients getting resistance or their tumor has stopped responding, we probably shouldn't mess around with just trying to see what happens if we keep the chemo a little bit longer and do one more scan. We probably should just go with our gut where we know that the cancer is probably developing some resistance and give people more therapy, different therapy. And here, Taxol and Ranucerumab is the example. Kind of goes back to that funnel diagram I showed you earlier where some people never even get a chance to get second-line therapy. And so here, I think the take-home message is that we really need to do justice to our patients and try to expose them to as many different ways to kill tumor cells as possible. Because, honestly, we don't really know if someone's going to respond to a therapy until we do it. Sometimes we have a pretty good guess, but you don't really know until you try. And so here, it's a reminder that you really need to try. Don't miss your window to try to give someone treatment. All right, keynote 585. Now we're moving back into the stage 2, 3 patients. And a lot of people, you know, a lot of people with stage 4, we know that giving, you know, Folfox plus immune therapies like pembrolizumab or nivolumab do improve the survival for many patients. So if it works in stage 4, like why doesn't it work in stage 3? We've done that for a lot of cancers. We're not that creative. We just do something in stage four, and then we try to do it in stage three. And this is exactly what Keynote 585 did. So these were basically stage two and three patients, mostly stage three patients, who had tumors that could technically be removed surgically, and they were randomized to either chemotherapy plus pembrolizumab or chemotherapy plus placebo. And the chemotherapies were slightly different. There's one group that got FLOT, and there's one group that got essentially cisplatin and 5-FU or capecitabine. And then we follow them. And the goal here was to see if we can delay recurrence. So that's called event-free survival. And, of course, improve overall survival, which is cures. So this trial has already been reported, and it was updated at ESMO just at the end of June. And so these are the people, many of them are just like you who went on. You see that most of these patients had gastric cancer, so 80% stomach and 20% GE junction. Most of the tumors were stage 3, like I told you. Most of the patients were not MSI, but remember, you need to test because about almost 10% are MSI. So these people are the ones who really want to get immunotherapy into. and then what we do know is that a lot of people see their pathology report and they'll see something like you know not a good response and they get all worried that the chemo didn't do anything it didn't work and so when you add immune therapy you can increase the response in the tumor and it goes from you know 2 to 10 12 13 percent which it's nice to see that that's That's nice. But we don care as much about what it looks like at the time of surgery We want to cure more people And so that what event survival and overall survival look at So here is the immunotherapy curve on top and the placebo curve on the bottom. So you see by numbers alone, adding immune therapy delayed the time to recurrence. So one group, the recurrence happened at about a little over two years, and the other group, it was even close to four years. However, because of the design of the clinical trial, even though these numbers are different, the statistics, the way the study was designed, there was no difference. And so this is considered a negative clinical trial, even though the numbers themselves do kind of stand out and jump at you. If you look at overall survival, you see, again, now we're talking more about actual cures. you see the curves are actually pretty close at the end there's maybe some separation so here there's not a big difference in cure rates between the two strategies you know immunotherapy or no immune therapy and this hazard ratio is basically a comparison between the two arms but the nice thing to see is that we're actually getting better at giving therapy the survival here is this number of 55 months is actually better than what we've seen in the past. So just as a whole, we're getting better at treating patients with stage 2 and 3 cancers, and so the numbers are slowly improving. Obviously, we want to do much better and, you know, cure many more patients, but at least there's some hope. Again, looking at clues to see if there's people who really benefit. You see this MSI high people. You see this bar is over here that says works better for the immunotherapy. MSI patients do really well with immunotherapy, so they should get immunotherapy for sure. Again, T-note 811 is the HERD2 study, and so these are patients with HERD2 positive cancers. This is about 20% of all stomach cancer. And what was seen in the past is that Merck announced in February this year that actually this trial is positive for survival. So adding pembrolizumab on top of chemo plus trastuzumab improves the survival for patients. And you can see the numbers here. This is the earlier reporting is about four months, maybe five months of improved survival. And so that's actually pretty meaningful. So we haven't seen the actual data, so this may be presented at the main ESMO meeting in September this year or another meeting. We don't know for sure. But we do know from Merck that the trial is positive for survival. So we may have more evidence to say that immune therapy helps the HER2 patients as well. Spotlight and GLOW. So I'm only going to talk about Spotlight because it's probably more relevant to everyone in the U.S. The only difference between Spotlight and GLOW is that one trial used FOLFOX, which is the much more common chemo that we use, and GLOW used a chemo called CAPOX, which is a pill chemotherapy plus the oxaliplatin that gives you the cold sensitivity. And that was more commonly a regimen in Asia. So the trial had already been reported. We already knew that adding clodin therapy on top of chemo for patients that are clodin positive in the tumor cells, we already knew that that made people live longer. When you have longer-term follow-up, you can be even more precise and tell people, you know, because patients want to know, like, what's the chances that I'm going to be alive in two years or one year or three years or five years? When we have longer-term follow-up, we can tell you all those kind of numbers. So this is busy, but the next slide I zoomed in. And so the right, I mean, the left here is progression-free survival. So this is the time on treatment before your tumor becomes resistant. And B over here is overall survival. So chemo only is the gray line, and chemo plus zolbituximab is the red line. So you see if you look out at 22 years or three years for survival or four years, you can say that, you know, with the addition of zolvotuximab, your chance of being alive at three years with stage four disease is about 20%, whereas it's only about 15% with chemo alone. And that's the way you can interpret these curves. And then if you look at the sort of the average, the median, you see that we improve survival by about three months. So, again, you know, this is not the numbers we want. We want, you know, improved people's survival by years. But unfortunately, you know, we haven't gotten that good yet. But this is really very similar to immune therapy. When you add immune therapy on top of chemo, you see curves that look a lot like this. you see more people alive at the later time points, similar to zolbatuximab. So it just kind of validates the idea that giving clodin therapies improves survival. And there probably will be many other clodin therapies. Zolbatuximab is just the first. There's a bunch of other targets, and I want to make sure we have time for questions, so I'm going to go a little quick through the last few slides. But FGFR2B is one we get a lot of questions about. You know, can you test my tumor? Can you do anything about it? Right now, unfortunately, the answer to both of those questions is mostly no. Some places can test, but we don't have approved drugs yet. But there may be a drug coming. So Amgen has this drug called demaratuzumab, which in a phase two study has already shown a lot of promising activity. So basically, this drug binds to FGFR2B, which is on about somewhere in the 15 to 25 percent of all patients, depends on what cutoff you use. And when you add it on top of standard chemotherapy, you start to see things like this. So again, the top curve is with the new drug and placebo is the lower curve. So you start to see improvements. And these are pretty meaningful. You know, this is like 10, 15, almost 20% improvement in survival numbers. And so we're all awaiting these two trials, Fortitude 101 and Fortitude 102. So one is adding FGFR2 therapy on top of chemo, and the other combines it with immunotherapy. And again, this goes back to that funnel diagram I showed you where really we want to take our best shot in the beginning. So even though it seems like a lot to get chemo plus immune therapy plus targeted therapy, it might be the best thing for patients. You know, if we keep more people alive and extend their survival, we'll get better at giving it and balancing the side effects because all of our drugs, of course, have to have side effects. So we're excited about this. Maybe it will be the next target. You know, we have to wait for the data. That's why we do the trials. There's a few other ones, too. This is MET. So MET is seen in 5% of patients have what's called MET amplified, but almost 30% or more of patients have high MET protein on the tumor cells. And so this, what I'm showing you is a new drug that's mostly been tested in colon cancer, but there is data in stomach and esophagus. And there's a bunch of trials that are coming, including probably some phase three trials. And so this is a different type of drug. What's shown over here on the right is a picture of an antibody. And then these yellow, these red dots are chemotherapy that's basically stuck onto the antibody. So the antibody goes and binds to the tumor cell, and it sticks on there, and then it delivers the chemotherapy. It's basically a sneaky way of getting chemo right to the tumor rather than just putting it in your vein and having it go everywhere, you know, normal cells plus the tumor. This is probably a way to get higher dose chemo right to the cancer, which has a better chance of killing it. And so this is colon cancer patients. So no stomach and esophagus patients here, but you can see that these are patients who have seen a lot of treatment. So a lot of these people have already had four different types of chemo before they even went on to this trial. So that's usually a group that's hard to treat. And what they saw is that at the low dose, there wasn't a ton of activity. Only 6% of people had responses. But as they move the dose up, you see that, you know, 20, 25 percent of people are having responses. So these are called waterfall plots. Each bar is a patient. Bars going up is tumor growing. Bars going down is tumor shrinking. And these percentages are how much the tumor shrank or grew. So you see that some of these people had like 80 percent decrease in their tumor. A lot of people had, you know, 20% had more than a 30% decrease. And so this is a promising early signal, but still pretty early. So new drug. The other one, which I didn't have a slide but I'll talk about, is from Arcus and Gilead, which is TIGIT. And this was a trial called STAR-221. Some of you probably heard about it. Some of you may even participated on it. Now, this is a study that is essentially combining two immune therapies versus the standard of one immune therapy. And the trial is already done. We just have to wait for the results to see if adding a second immune therapy, in this case, the immunotherapy is called TIGIT, will improve survival. So, again, this is what we talked about. This is the punchline. This is me. You can email me or reach out anytime. And then I want to end by just highlighting this video that I recently did with Debbie's Dream, which is really just more focused about biomarker testing and why you need to do it, what we do with that information. And it's really mostly about, you know, the more information we have, the better chance we have of treating your cancer the right way. So there's a link down here if you want to listen to me talk anymore. You may not want to do that. But all right, time for questions, and I will go back on video. And thanks for everyone who stayed on. Hi, everyone. So I will get these questions going. And please, as we are doing the Q&A session, feel free to keep typing in the questions. So one question that came through, what can you tell about sentinel navigation surgery? Oh, what is there, a surgeon on this call? So tensile node navigation is basically the idea that when cancer is spread from the lining of the stomach, They obviously can access the lymphatic system, which connects all the lymph nodes in the body. And usually they go to lymph nodes that are kind of right next to the tumor. But it's actually very hard to predict that. You know, we look at CT scans and PET scans and we say if something lights up or if it's big, we say, hey, that lymph node is probably involved with the cancer. But when the surgeons are in there, there's actually technologies that they use in like breast cancer and melanoma where you can inject a dye like kind of right before you go to surgery or in the operating room. And the dye goes into the bloodstream and it gets taken up and it goes in the tumor and then it follows the tumor out to the lymph node. You can also other strategies where they inject the tumors, et cetera. But essentially, you're looking for the lymph node that lights up. And that tells you the most likely lymph node or the first stop on the road for the cancer cell on the way to the lymph nodes. And sometimes it will tell a surgeon a surprise. You know, most of the time the surgeons are going to take all the lymph nodes out anyway. But sometimes a sentinel lymph node mapping procedure might find a lymph node that the surgeon didn't suspect or may not have taken out. It's not a standard thing to do yet. A lot of centers, our own center, a lot of other big centers use this tool. It's still considered a research tool, but they will use it to help guide the surgeons and make sure that they're getting all the right lymph nodes. That's really the take-home. And what makes gastric cancer have such a dismal survival rate that the survival rate has not changed much in the last 30 years? Oh, you're like criticizing my whole career. No, I'm just kidding. No, the big problem is that we don't meet our patients until their disease is advanced. And by that time, the cancer has been there usually a long time. It's had a lot of time to evolve. It's had a lot of time to figure out how to hide from the immune system and how to become kind of nasty. and our drugs just aren't good enough to deal with that problem. You know, we're getting better. We biomarker test and we find some patients where we do awesome. And you probably all know people who are like alive five years with stage four disease. You know, we all love to see that. In other countries like Korea and Japan, where they have a lot more gastric cancer, they actually start screening people when they're like 35 or 40. And so just like breast cancer and colon cancer in the U.S., when you screen people, you tend to find cancers earlier. So stage one, stage two. The outcomes for stage one and stage two cancers are really good. You know, a majority of patients are cured. And so the outcomes in Asia are better. You know, their five-year survival on average is, you know, 30 percent or 40 percent, whereas in the U.S., it's like 5 percent. And it's not because the cancers themselves are very different or the treatment is very different. It's largely the same. It's just on average they diagnose people earlier, and earlier stage patients do better. Thank you. There are a growing number of younger patients, correct? Can these studies present the data by age group to see if younger patients respond better than older patients to the various control and experimental treatment groups? Oh, man, that's an awesome question. Sometimes we can see some clues in the subgroup analyses, and maybe if I can go back in my â€“ can I go back? Yeah. I'll try to find a slide. We don't do a very good job of this, to be honest, but I will find a couple examples. So here you see age less than 65 age over 65 and you see the older patients a higher number on this side a hazard ratio means less benefit And so older patients get less benefit than younger patients from adding immune therapy in this case Why 65 and above and below? You know, that's kind of arbitrary, and we don't do a good job breaking out further groups. We also know that getting chemo when you're older, like over 75, is harder. you have more medical problems there's harder issues with blood counts people unfortunately can have a harder time and sort of run into nutritional problems a little bit quicker and so also young patients are underrepresented on trials as well so we just don't have as many numbers to do the comparison you know we would love to know if people under 45 do as well as people over 45. We just don't usually do a good job of that, but it's a great question. Young, on average, there is more and more young onset cancers. And for reasons that we don't totally understand, some of these cancers are quite aggressive, particularly in gastric cancer. There's a rising incidence in young Hispanic women, and we don't know totally why, But it does seem to be observed in the epidemiology world. Question. How often do you see material differences in biomarkers where it actually could change the course of treatment when patients maybe had biomarkers tested at diagnosis and then a year later or so has them repeated? Specifically, I'm asking about hereditary diffuse gastric cancer and not intestinal gastric cancer. Yeah, good question. So some biomarkers are very unlikely to change, like MSI status. So if you have an MSS tumor and you get therapy, it's exceedingly unlikely that it would ever convert to an MSI high tumor. That basically almost never happens. The most common scenario and the places where biomarker testing or repeat biomarker testing is most helpful is if you had a target and you got a therapy that hit that target. So if you got a HER2 positive tumor and you treated it with HER2 therapy, the concern is that the therapy works well. So it kills off all the HER2 positive cells and what's left behind is HER2 negative tumor cells. And so in those patients, when the tumor grows, we like to repeat the biopsy because we don't want to give them more therapy against the target if they don't have the target anymore. And so if you've had a targeted therapy, that's the best time to repeat. The same thing is probably going to be true for Clodin. Same thing is going to be true for FGFR2. it's very important for us to understand if we give you a targeted therapy and it works for a year and then it stops working we need to understand how your tumor adapted and one of the ways the tumors do is by changing the target if you just got regular chemotherapy like unfortunately many hereditary diffuse type gastric cancer patients are HER2 negative and PDL1 negative and an MSI negative and you've just got chemotherapy like Folfox, it's quite unlikely that your biomarkers will change. But, you know, my own philosophy is it's very unlikely, but it's not never. And so if we want to do our best to give you the chance of the best later on treatments and there's something safe that we can biopsy pretty easily, you know, I will usually have that discussion with patients and say, hey, you know, we can do this. It's still a procedure you have to go through. It might be, you know, an outpatient liver biopsy, for example. Chances are it's not going to change anything for you, but there's a small chance that we might pick up something new where maybe we have a clinical trial. Maybe it's something we didn't see in the beginning. But for people who don't get targeted therapies, on average, it's relatively rare that it will change, but it doesn't mean never. Yeah. Will Zolby ever be given a long-set immunotherapy or other targeted therapies, and will it ever be given as a second, third, fourth line therapy? The answer, I'm going to talk generally about Clawden, and then I'll talk about Zolby. So Zolby is two positive phase three trials. You know, the FDA is going to review this on November 9th. And I think all of us are expecting that shortly after that, we will have zolbituximab as a tool available to us for clotting positive patients. There is an ongoing trial that's open at MGH. It's open at a lot of places called Illustro. And Illustro is testing Folfox plus zolbituximab plus nivolumab. So exactly what you said, chemotherapy plus targeted therapy plus immune therapy. We're hopeful that that trial will show, you know, more activity and maybe a pathway to getting people this triplet type of approach, like we do for HER2-positive patients. But we have to wait to see the data. There's other clotting drugs like TST-001, which have also shown some early data combining chemo with targeted therapy, with immune therapy. And the triplet combination does look active and pretty safe. So short answer is yes. I think we will probably see combinations with immune therapy. Zolbatuximab in second and third line, we really have very limited data. And the data we have has not been so great, but it was tested like without chemo. It was like zolbatuximab plus pembrolizumab. That did not work very well. However, there's a lot of interest in other clodin strategies, like that antibody drug conjugate I showed you, where you link chemo on top of a targeted therapy. So there's a drug from AstraZeneca called AZD0901. And there's a phase three trial in the second and third line, which is called CLARITY, C-L-A-R-I-T-Y, that, you know, we're going to have it open. And many, many big centers will have this trial open. It's a big international trial. And so there, that will be an agent that I think is active. And that might be something where if someone got, in the future, if the drug's approved, we would definitely consider it for someone who got, like, zolvetuximab in the first line and they're still clodin positive. Like, I would definitely think about giving them a clodin ADC or other clodin therapies in later lines. Obviously, we need to see the data to make sure that that's okay, but I suspect it will be. Can you comment on the potential role of tristuzumab, durexacin, and HER low gastric cancer? Oh, yeah, very so. If you follow breast cancer world, you've probably seen that used to do therapy for HER2 positive, and that was defined, you know, similar to stomach cancer. And then they realized that some of these drugs, you only need a little bit of the target, in this case HER2, you only need a little bit of the target to land your drug. You might not need all of the HER2 that we traditionally think of. So in breast cancer, they did some studies, and they call these HER2 low or HER2 ultra low or whatever term is cool, and they have shown that the drugs work. And so we're basically copying them in stomach cancer and saying the same thing. You know, if it works for HER2 low breast cancer, maybe we should try it in HER2 low stomach cancer. So there was a trial called Destiny Gastric 01. And it was really small groups, but they tested two groups. One people who were 2 plus under the microscope. So that means that like cells had moderate intensity of staining, but they were fish negative. So by technical definition, we call that HER2 negative by our current definitions, or in this case, HER2 low. And the other group was HER2 1+. And in the 1+, group, TDXD did not work very well. The response rate was around 10%. But in the other group, the 2+, and FISH negative, the response rate was like 25% or 26%. So actually pretty good. And this was, you know, second line patient population. A third line patient population. And so I think the answer is yes. There are a bunch of companies and trials trying to test this. Some people using TDXD in combination with like bispecific immune therapy. So like a double immune antibody. but short answer is yes I think people will continue there's also been some ongoing evidence of combining TDXD with ramicirumab in the second line for HER2 low patients and so it's definitely an area of active trials outside of a clinical trial it's not something we do very often one the drug's not approved and two we really don't have enough evidence to say that it improves survival, which of course is what we want to do. Do you recommend a certain diet for stomach cancer patients to follow while they are having treatment, for example, keto? Honestly, I'm just happy if my patients are eating well because that means we have, you know, achieved some degree of tumor control and not too much side effects from the treatment. I think kind of like everybody used to say, you know, everything in moderation. I think diets that are excessively high in anything are probably not good. But the short answer is no. We don't have a particular diet. We want, you know, we know patients need relatively protein-rich foods to maintain their nutrition during therapy. We want healthy fats. You know, nut butters like peanut butter and almond butter or cashew butter are good sources of fats and calories. um intermittent fasting and ketogenic diets there is some thinking that you know cancer cells don't like that and they don't in a dish um it's been a little bit harder to prove in patients um so until we have more convincing data you know i i obviously we have dieticians and everything but tend to just be happy if people are able to maintain their weight and and tolerate a sort of balanced that diet. What patients are not candidates for immunotherapy? Oh, big question. People who have severe autoimmune diseases where they're already on like steroids or other immune suppressing drugs, usually we don't give immunotherapy to those patients because we're worried that it could cause, you know, severe flare of their underlying autoimmune disease, which could hurt our ability to give them anything like even chemo. The other group that really don't seem to get much benefit from immune therapy is people who truly have PD-L1 negative cancers. So this is a tricky area, and there is some variability in here if you ask, you know, 10 different oncologists. But I think we can all agree that people who have PD-L1 positive tumors get the most benefit from adding immune therapy. People who have PD-L1 negative tumors, which is probably only around 20, 25% of people, when you add immune therapy to those patients on top of chemo, we really don't improve the survival. So you're basically potentially adding a drug with real risk. You know, immune therapies do have risks with essentially a very limited chance of benefit. And so most of us will generally have that conversation with patients and many times will not give immune therapy. You know, currently the FDA labels allow us to do give immune therapy to essentially all patients. That may change in the future. We'll see. But people with contraindications to the drug, which is usually severe autoimmune conditions, or PBL1 negative tumors, those are the main buckets of people who don't really benefit from immune therapy or don't get the drug. Thank you. Can you speculate on the potential role of multi-cancer early detection testing and early diagnosis of gastric cancer? When do you think this might be available? Yeah, and I think this might have to be the last question because I've got to run to a meeting. But, yes, MSEDs or multi-cancer early detection tests are a very hot area. Essentially, these tests leverage the idea that cancer cell DNA is different than normal cell DNA, whether it's mutations or what's called methylation, which is basically like little tags put on the DNA to control genes. And so if we know that there's a difference between normal and abnormal DNA, can we develop a test to pick that up? And the answer is probably yes in the future. Some of these tests are already not so bad. The big question is, do they improve survival for patients? That's ultimately the bar. You know, if you find a cancer when it's one millimeter versus you find it when it's three millimeters with a mammogram, does that really matter? And so far, we haven't really been able to prove that. The tests are getting better and better. So it's nice because they're noninvasive. They're usually blood tests. You could, in theory, do urine or stool, but most of them are built on blood. And in the future, I think this is going to be part of, you know, maybe even routine care. like you go to your primary care when you're 40 and you get a blood test. That's still probably a few years away, but I think we're all super excited because we know if we find tumors in earlier stage that we have a better chance of curing. Thank you, Dr. Klempner.
